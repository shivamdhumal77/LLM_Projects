As my\\nclassmate took a full swing, the bat slipped out of his hands\\nand came ﬂying toward me before striking me directly\\nbetween the eyes. I have no memory of the moment of\\nimpact.\\nThe bat smashed into my face with such force that it\\ncrushed my nose into a distorted U -shape. The collision\\nsent the soft tissue of my brain slamming into the inside of\\nmy skull. Immediately , a wave of swelling surged\\nthroughout my head. In a fraction of a second, I had a\\nbroken nose, multiple skull fractures, and two shattered\\neye sockets.\\nWhen I opened my eyes, I saw people staring at me and\\nrunning over to help. I looked down and noticed spots of\\nred on my clothes. One of my classmates took the shirt oﬀ\\nhis back and handed it to me. I used it to plug the stream of\\nblood rushing from my broken nose. Shocked and confused,\\nI was unaware of how seriously I had been injured.\\nMy teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we\\nbegan the long walk to the nurse’s oﬀice: across the ﬁeld,\\ndown the hill, and back into school. R andom hands touched\\nmy sides, holding me upright. W e took our time and walked\\nslowly . Nobody realized that every minute mattered.\\nWhen we arrived at the nurse’s oﬀice, she asked me a\\nseries of questions.\\n“What year is it?”\\n“1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002.\\n“Who is the president of the United States?”\\n“Bill Clinton,” I said. The correct answer was George W .\\nBush.\\n“What is your mom’s name?”\\n“Uh. Um.” I stalled. T en seconds passed.\\n“Patti,” I said casually , ignoring the fact that it had taken\\nme ten seconds to remember my own mother’s name.\\nThat is the last question I remember . My body was\\nunable to handle the rapid swelling in my brain and I lost\\nconsciousness before the ambulance arrived. Minutes later ,\\nI was carried out of school and taken to the local hospital.\\nShortly after arriving, my body began shutting down. I\\nstruggled with basic functions like swallowing and\\nbreathing. I had my ﬁrst seizure of the day . Then I stopped\\nbreathing entirely . As the doctors hurried to supply me with\\noxygen, they also decided the local hospital was\\nunequipped to handle the situation and ordered a\\nhelicopter to ﬂy me to a larger hospital in Cincinnati.\\nI was rolled out of the emergency room doors and toward\\nthe helipad across the street. The stretcher rattled on a\\nbumpy sidewalk as one nurse pushed me along while\\nanother pumped each breath into me by hand. My mother ,\\nwho had arrived at the hospital a few moments before,\\nclimbed into the helicopter beside me. I remained\\nunconscious and unable to breathe on my own as she held\\nmy hand during the ﬂight.\\nWhile my mother rode with me in the helicopter , my\\nfather went home to check on my brother and sister and\\nbreak the news to them. He choked back tears as he\\nexplained to my sister that he would miss her eighth-grade\\ngraduation ceremony that night. A fter passing my siblings\\noﬀ to family and friends, he drove to Cincinnati to meet my\\nmother .\\nWhen my mom and I landed on the roof of the hospital, a\\nteam of nearly twenty doctors and nurses sprinted onto the\\nhelipad and wheeled me into the trauma unit. By this time,\\nthe swelling in my brain had become so severe that I was\\nhaving repeated post-traumatic seizures. My broken bones\\nneeded to be ﬁxed, but I was in no condition to undergo\\nsurgery . After yet another seizure—my third of the day—I\\nwas put into a medically induced coma and placed on a\\nventilator .\\nMy parents were no strangers to this hospital. T en years\\nearlier , they had entered the same building on the ground\\nﬂoor after my sister was diagnosed with leukemia at age\\nthree. I was ﬁve at the time. My brother was just six\\nmonths old. A fter two and a half years of chemotherapy\\ntreatments, spinal taps, and bone marrow biopsies, my\\nlittle sister ﬁnally walked out of the hospital happy , healthy ,\\nand cancer free. And now , after ten years of normal life, my\\nparents found themselves back in the same place with a\\ndiﬀerent child.\\nWhile I slipped into a coma, the hospital sent a priest and\\na social worker to comfort my parents. It was the same\\npriest who had met with them a decade earlier on the\\nevening they found out my sister had cancer .\\nAs day faded into night, a series of machines kept me\\nalive. My parents slept restlessly on a hospital mattress—\\none moment they would collapse from fatigue, the next\\nthey would be wide awake with worry . My mother would\\ntell me later , “It was one of the worst nights I’ve ever had.”\\nMY RECO VERY\\nMercifully , by the next morning my breathing had\\nrebounded to the point where the doctors felt comfortable\\nreleasing me from the coma. When I ﬁnally regained\\nconsciousness, I discovered that I had lost my ability to\\nsmell. As a test, a nurse asked me to blow my nose and sniﬀ\\nan apple juice box. My sense of smell returned, but—to\\neveryone’s surprise—the act of blowing my nose forced air\\nthrough the fractures in my eye socket and pushed my left\\neye outward. My eyeball bulged out of the socket, held\\nprecariously in place by my eyelid and the optic nerve\\nattaching my eye to my brain.\\nThe ophthalmologist said my eye would gradually slide\\nback into place as the air seeped out, but it was hard to tell\\nhow long this would take. I was scheduled for surgery one\\nweek later , which would allow me some additional time to\\nheal. I looked like I had been on the wrong end of a boxing\\nmatch, but I was cleared to leave the hospital. I returned\\nhome with a broken nose, half a dozen facial fractures, and\\na bulging left eye.\\nThe following months were hard. It felt like everything in\\nmy life was on pause. I had double vision for weeks; I\\nliterally couldn’t see straight. It took more than a month,\\nbut my eyeball did eventually return to its normal location.\\nBetween the seizures and my vision problems, it was eight\\nmonths before I could drive a car again. A t physical\\ntherapy , I practiced basic motor patterns like walking in a\\nstraight line. I was determined not to let my injury get me\\ndown, but there were more than a few moments when I felt\\ndepressed and overwhelmed.\\nI became painfully aware of how far I had to go when I\\nreturned to the baseball ﬁeld one year later . Baseball had\\nalways been a major part of my life. My dad had played\\nminor league baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals, and I had\\na dream of playing professionally , too. After months of\\nrehabilitation, what I wanted more than anything was to\\nget back on the ﬁeld.\\nBut my return to baseball was not smooth. When the\\nseason rolled around, I was the only junior to be cut from\\nthe varsity baseball team. I was sent down to play with the\\nsophomores on junior varsity . I had been playing since age\\nfour, and for someone who had spent so much time and\\neﬀort on the sport, getting cut was humiliating. I vividly\\nremember the day it happened. I sat in my car and cried as\\nI ﬂipped through the radio, desperately searching for a\\nsong that would make me feel better .\\nAfter a year of self -doubt, I managed to make the varsity\\nteam as a senior , but I rarely made it on the ﬁeld. In total, I\\nplayed eleven innings of high school varsity baseball,\\nbarely more than a single game.\\nDespite my lackluster high school career , I still believed I\\ncould become a great player . And I knew that if things were\\ngoing to improve, I was the one responsible for making it\\nhappen. The turning point came two years after my injury ,\\nwhen I began college at Denison University . It was a new\\nbeginning, and it was the place where I would discover the\\nsurprising power of small habits for the ﬁrst time.\\nHOW I LEARNED ABOUT HABITS\\nAttending Denison was one of the best decisions of my life.\\nI earned a spot on the baseball team and, although I was at\\nthe bottom of the roster as a freshman, I was thrilled.\\nDespite the chaos of my high school years, I had managed\\nto become a college athlete.\\nI wasn’t going to be starting on the baseball team\\nanytime soon, so I focused on getting my life in order .\\nWhile my peers stayed up late and played video games, I\\nbuilt good sleep habits and went to bed early each night. In\\nthe messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep\\nmy room neat and tidy . These improvements were minor ,\\nbut they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started\\nto feel conﬁdent again. And this growing belief in myself\\nrippled into the classroom as I improved my study habits\\nand managed to earn straight A ’s during my ﬁrst year .\\nA habit is a routine or behavior that is performed\\nregularly—and, in many cases, automatically . As each\\nsemester passed, I accumulated small but consistent habits\\nthat ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me\\nwhen I started. F or example, for the ﬁrst time in my life, I\\nmade it a habit to lift weights multiple times per week, and\\nin the years that followed, my six -foot-four-inch frame\\nbulked up from a featherweight 170 to a lean 200 pounds.\\nWhen my sophomore season arrived, I earned a starting\\nrole on the pitching staﬀ . By my junior year , I was voted\\nteam captain and at the end of the season, I was selected\\nfor the all-conference team. But it was not until my senior\\nseason that my sleep habits, study habits, and strength-\\ntraining habits really began to pay oﬀ .\\nSix years after I had been hit in the face with a baseball\\nbat, ﬂown to the hospital, and placed into a coma, I was\\nselected as the top male athlete at Denison University and\\nnamed to the ESPN Academic All-America T eam—an honor\\ngiven to just thirty-three players across the country . By the\\ntime I graduated, I was listed in the school record books in\\neight diﬀerent categories. That same year , I was awarded\\nthe university’s highest academic honor , the President’s\\nMedal.\\nI hope you’ll forgive me if this sounds boastful. T o be\\nhonest, there was nothing legendary or historic about my\\nathletic career . I never ended up playing professionally .\\nHowever , looking back on those years, I believe I\\naccomplished something just as rare: I fulﬁlled my\\npotential. And I believe the concepts in this book can help\\nyou fulﬁll your potential as well.\\nWe all face challenges in life. This injury was one of\\nmine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson:\\nchanges that seem small and unimportant at ﬁrst will\\ncompound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick\\nwith them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the\\nlong run, the quality of our lives often depends on the\\nquality of our habits. W ith the same habits, you’ll end up\\nwith the same results. But with better habits, anything is\\npossible.\\nMaybe there are people who can achieve incredible\\nsuccess overnight. I don’t know any of them, and I’m\\ncertainly not one of them. There wasn’t one deﬁning\\nmoment on my journey from medically induced coma to\\nAcademic All-American; there were many . It was a gradual\\nevolution, a long series of small wins and tiny\\nbreakthroughs. The only way I made progress—the only\\nchoice I had—was to start small. And I employed this same\\nstrategy a few years later when I started my own business\\nand began working on this book.\\nHOW AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK\\nIn November 2012, I began publishing articles at\\njamesclear .com. F or years, I had been keeping notes about\\nmy personal experiments with habits and I was ﬁnally\\nready to share some of them publicly . I began by publishing\\na new article every Monday and Thursday . Within a few\\nmonths, this simple writing habit led to my ﬁrst one\\nthousand email subscribers, and by the end of 2013 that\\nnumber had grown to more than thirty thousand people.\\nIn 2014, my email list expanded to over one hundred\\nthousand subscribers, which made it one of the fastest-\\ngrowing newsletters on the internet. I had felt like an\\nimpostor when I began writing two years earlier , but now I\\nwas becoming known as an expert on habits—a new label\\nthat excited me but also felt uncomfortable. I had never\\nconsidered myself a master of the topic, but rather\\nsomeone who was experimenting alongside my readers.\\nIn 2015, I reached two hundred thousand email\\nsubscribers and signed a book deal with P enguin R andom\\nHouse to begin writing the book you are reading now . As\\nmy audience grew , so did my business opportunities. I was\\nincreasingly asked to speak at top companies about the\\nscience of habit formation, behavior change, and\\ncontinuous improvement. I found myself delivering keynote\\nspeeches at conferences in the United States and Europe.\\nIn 2016, my articles began to appear regularly in major\\npublications like Time , Entrepreneur , and Forbes .\\nIncredibly , my writing was read by over eight million\\npeople that year . Coaches in the NFL, NBA, and MLB\\nbegan reading my work and sharing it with their teams.\\nAt the start of 2017, I launched the Habits Academy ,\\nwhich became the premier training platform for\\norganizations and individuals interested in building better\\nhabits in life and work. * Fortune 500 companies and\\ngrowing start-ups began to enroll their leaders and train\\ntheir staﬀ . In total, over ten thousand leaders, managers,\\ncoaches, and teachers have graduated from the Habits\\nAcademy , and my work with them has taught me an\\nincredible amount about what it takes to make habits work\\nin the real world.\\nAs I put the ﬁnishing touches on this book in 2018,\\njamesclear .com is receiving millions of visitors per month\\nand nearly ﬁve hundred thousand people subscribe to my\\nweekly email newsletter—a number that is so far beyond\\nmy expectations when I began that I’m not even sure what\\nto think of it.\\nHOW THIS BOOK WILL BENEFIT Y OU\\nThe entrepreneur and investor Naval R avikant has said, “T o\\nwrite a great book, you must ﬁrst become the book.” I\\noriginally learned about the ideas mentioned here because\\nI had to live them. I had to rely on small habits to rebound\\nfrom my injury , to get stronger in the gym, to perform at a\\nhigh level on the ﬁeld, to become a writer , to build a\\nsuccessful business, and simply to develop into a\\nresponsible adult. Small habits helped me fulﬁll my\\npotential, and since you picked up this book, I’m guessing\\nyou’d like to fulﬁll yours as well.\\nIn the pages that follow , I will share a step-by-step plan\\nfor building better habits—not for days or weeks, but for a\\nlifetime. While science supports everything I’ve written,\\nthis book is not an academic research paper; it’s an\\noperating manual. Y ou’ll ﬁnd wisdom and practical advice\\nfront and center as I explain the science of how to create\\nand change your habits in a way that is easy to understand\\nand apply .\\nThe ﬁelds I draw on—biology , neuroscience, philosophy ,\\npsychology , and more—have been around for many years.\\nWhat I oﬀer you is a synthesis of the best ideas smart\\npeople ﬁgured out a long time ago as well as the most\\ncompelling discoveries scientists have made recently . My\\ncontribution, I hope, is to ﬁnd the ideas that matter most\\nand connect them in a way that is highly actionable.\\nAnything wise in these pages you should credit to the many\\nexperts who preceded me. Anything foolish, assume it is my\\nerror .\\nThe backbone of this book is my four-step model of\\nhabits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four\\nlaws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps.\\nReaders with a psychology background may recognize\\nsome of these terms from operant conditioning, which was\\nﬁrst proposed as “ stimulus, response, reward” by B. F .\\nSkinner in the 1930s and has been popularized more\\nrecently as “ cue, routine, reward” in The P ower of Habit  by\\nCharles Duhigg.\\nBehavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you\\noﬀered the right reward or punishment, you could get\\npeople to act in a certain way . But while Skinner’s model\\ndid an excellent job of explaining how external stimuli\\ninﬂuenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for how\\nour thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior .\\nInternal states—our moods and emotions—matter , too. In\\nrecent decades, scientists have begun to determine the\\nconnection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior .\\nThis research will also be covered in these pages.\\nIn total, the framework I oﬀer is an integrated model of\\nthe cognitive and behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of\\nthe ﬁrst models of human behavior to accurately account\\nfor both the inﬂuence of external stimuli and internal\\nemotions on our habits. While some of the language may be\\nfamiliar , I am conﬁdent that the details—and the\\napplications of the F our Laws of Behavior Change—will\\noﬀer a new way to think about your habits.\\nHuman behavior is always changing: situation to\\nsituation, moment to moment, second to second. But this\\nbook is about what doesn’t  change. It’s about the\\nfundamentals of human behavior . The lasting principles you\\ncan rely on year after year . The ideas you can build a\\nbusiness around, build a family around, build a life around.\\nThere is no one right way to create better habits, but this\\nbook describes the best way I know—an approach that will\\nbe eﬀective regardless of where you start or what you’re\\ntrying to change. The strategies I cover will be relevant to\\nanyone looking for a step-by-step system for improvement,\\nwhether your goals center on health, money , productivity ,\\nrelationships, or all of the above. As long as human\\nbehavior is involved, this book will be your guide.\\nTHE \\nFUNDAMENT ALS\\nWhy Tiny Changes Make a Big\\nDiﬀerence\\nT\\n1\\nThe Surprising P ower of A tomic Habits\\nHE F ATE OF British Cycling changed one day in 2003. The\\norganization, which was the governing body for\\nprofessional cycling in Great Britain, had recently hired\\nDave Brailsford as its new performance director . At the\\ntime, professional cyclists in Great Britain had endured\\nnearly one hundred years of mediocrity . Since 1908, British\\nriders had won just a single gold medal at the Olympic\\nGames, and they had fared even worse in cycling’s biggest\\nrace, the T our de France. In 110 years, no British cyclist\\nhad ever won the event.\\nIn fact, the performance of British riders had been so\\nunderwhelming that one of the top bike manufacturers in\\nEurope refused to sell bikes to the team because they were\\nafraid that it would hurt sales if other professionals saw the\\nBrits using their gear .\\nBrailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new\\ntrajectory . What made him diﬀerent from previous coaches\\nwas his relentless commitment to a strategy that he\\nreferred to as “the aggregation of marginal gains,” which\\nwas the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of\\nimprovement in everything you do . Brailsford said, “ The\\nwhole principle came from the idea that if you broke down\\neverything you could think of that goes into riding a bike,\\nand then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a signiﬁcant\\nincrease when you put them all together .”\\nBrailsford and his coaches began by making small\\nadjustments you might expect from a professional cycling\\nteam. They redesigned the bike seats to make them more\\ncomfortable and rubbed alcohol on the tires for a better\\ngrip. They asked riders to wear electrically heated\\novershorts to maintain ideal muscle temperature while\\nriding and used biofeedback sensors to monitor how each\\nathlete responded to a particular workout. The team tested\\nvarious fabrics in a wind tunnel and had their outdoor\\nriders switch to indoor racing suits, which proved to be\\nlighter and more aerodynamic.\\nBut they didn’t stop there. Brailsford and his team\\ncontinued to ﬁnd 1 percent improvements in overlooked\\nand unexpected areas. They tested diﬀerent types of\\nmassage gels to see which one led to the fastest muscle\\nrecovery . They hired a surgeon to teach each rider the best\\nway to wash their hands to reduce the chances of catching\\na cold. They determined the type of pillow and mattress\\nthat led to the best night’s sleep for each rider . They even\\npainted the inside of the team truck white, which helped\\nthem spot little bits of dust that would normally slip by\\nunnoticed but could degrade the performance of the ﬁnely\\ntuned bikes.\\nAs these and hundreds of other small improvements\\naccumulated, the results came faster than anyone could\\nhave imagined.\\nJust ﬁve years after Brailsford took over , the British\\nCycling team dominated the road and track cycling events\\nat the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, where they won an\\nastounding 60 percent of the gold medals available. F our\\nyears later , when the Olympic Games came to London, the\\nBrits raised the bar as they set nine Olympic records and\\nseven world records.\\nThat same year , Bradley W iggins became the ﬁrst British\\ncyclist to win the T our de France. The next year , his\\nteammate Chris Froome won the race, and he would go on\\nto win again in 2015, 2016, and 2017, giving the British\\nteam ﬁve T our de France victories in six years.\\nDuring the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British\\ncyclists won 178 world championships and sixty-six\\nOlympic or P aralympic gold medals and captured ﬁve T our\\nde France victories in what is widely regarded as the most\\nsuccessful run in cycling history .*\\nHow does this happen? How does a team of previously\\nordinary athletes transform into world champions with tiny\\nchanges that, at ﬁrst glance, would seem to make a modest\\ndiﬀerence at best? Why do small improvements accumulate\\ninto such remarkable results, and how can you replicate\\nthis approach in your own life?\\nWHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE\\nIt is so easy to overestimate the importance of one deﬁning\\nmoment and underestimate the value of making small\\nimprovements on a daily basis. T oo often, we convince\\nourselves that massive success requires massive action.\\nWhether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a\\nbook, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal,\\nwe put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-\\nshattering improvement that everyone will talk about.\\nMeanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly\\nnotable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable —but it can be\\nfar more meaningful, especially in the long run. The\\ndiﬀerence a tiny improvement can make over time is\\nastounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get\\n1 percent better each day for one year , you’ll end up thirty-\\nseven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely , if\\nyou get 1 percent worse each day for one year , you’ll\\ndecline nearly down to zero . What starts as a small win or a\\nminor setback accumulates into something much more.\\n1% BET TER EVER Y DAY\\n1% worse every day for one year . 0.99365 = 00.03\\n1% better every day for one year . 1.01365 = 37.78\\nFIGURE 1:  The eﬀects of small habits compound over time. F or\\nexample, if you can get just 1 per cent better each day, you’ll\\nend up with r esults that ar e nearly 37 times better af ter one\\nyear.\\nHabits are the compound interest of self -improvement.\\nThe same way that money multiplies through compound\\ninterest, the eﬀects of your habits multiply as you repeat\\nthem. They seem to make little diﬀerence on any given day\\nand yet the impact they deliver over the months and years\\ncan be enormous. It is only when looking back two, ﬁve, or\\nperhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and\\nthe cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.\\nThis can be a diﬀicult concept to appreciate in daily life.\\nWe often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to\\nmatter very much in the moment. If you save a little money\\nnow, you’re still not a millionaire. If you go to the gym three\\ndays in a row , you’re still out of shape. If you study\\nMandarin for an hour tonight, you still haven’t learned the\\nlanguage. W e make a few changes, but the results never\\nseem to come quickly and so we slide back into our\\nprevious routines.\\nUnfortunately , the slow pace of transformation also\\nmakes it easy to let a bad habit slide. If you eat an\\nunhealthy meal today , the scale doesn’t move much. If you\\nwork late tonight and ignore your family , they will forgive\\nyou. If you procrastinate and put your project oﬀ until\\ntomorrow , there will usually be time to ﬁnish it later . A\\nsingle decision is easy to dismiss.\\nBut when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day , by\\nreplicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and\\nrationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound\\ninto toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—\\na 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to\\na problem.\\nThe impact created by a change in your habits is similar\\nto the eﬀect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a\\nfew degrees. Imagine you are ﬂying from Los Angeles to\\nNew Y ork City . If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the\\nheading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in\\nWashington, D .C., instead of New Y ork. Such a small\\nchange is barely noticeable at takeoﬀ—the nose of the\\nairplane moves just a few feet—but when magniﬁed across\\nthe entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles\\napart. *\\nSimilarly , a slight change in your daily habits can guide\\nyour life to a very diﬀerent destination. Making a choice\\nthat is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems\\ninsigniﬁcant in the moment, but over the span of moments\\nthat make up a lifetime these choices determine the\\ndiﬀerence between who you are and who you could be.\\nSuccess is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-\\nlifetime transformations.\\nThat said, it doesn’t matter how successful or\\nunsuccessful you are right now . What matters is whether\\nyour habits are putting you on the path toward success. Y ou\\nshould be far more concerned with your current trajectory\\nthan with your current results. If you’re a millionaire but\\nyou spend more than you earn each month, then you’re on\\na bad trajectory . If your spending habits don’t change, it’s\\nnot going to end well. Conversely , if you’re broke, but you\\nsave a little bit every month, then you’re on the path\\ntoward ﬁnancial freedom—even if you’re moving slower\\nthan you’d like.\\nYour outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.\\nYour net worth is a lagging measure of your ﬁnancial\\nhabits. Y our weight is a lagging measure of your eating\\nhabits. Y our knowledge is a lagging measure of your\\nlearning habits. Y our clutter is a lagging measure of your\\ncleaning habits. Y ou get what you repeat.\\nIf you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you\\nhave to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses,\\nand see how your daily choices will compound ten or\\ntwenty years down the line. Are you spending less than you\\nearn each month? Are you making it into the gym each\\nweek? Are you reading books and learning something new\\neach day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will\\ndeﬁne your future self .\\nTime magniﬁes the margin between success and failure.\\nIt will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time\\nyour ally . Bad habits make time your enemy .\\nHabits are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you\\ndown just as easily as good habits can build you up, which\\nis why understanding the details is crucial. Y ou need to\\nknow how habits work and how to design them to your\\nliking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.\\nYOUR HABITS CAN COMPOUND FOR Y OU OR AGAINST Y OU\\nPositive Compounding\\nProductivity compounds. Accomplishing one e xtra task is a small feat on\\nany given day, but it counts for a lot over an entir e car eer. The eﬀect of\\nautomating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even gr eater . The mor e\\ntasks you can handle without thinking, the mor e your brain is fr ee to focus on\\nother ar eas.\\nKnowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won’t mak e you a genius,\\nbut a commitment to lifelong lear ning can be transfor mative. F urther more,\\neach book you r ead not only teaches you something new but also opens up\\ndiﬀer ent ways of thinking about old ideas. As W arren Buﬀett says, “That’s how\\nknowledge works. It builds up, lik e compound inter est.”\\nRelationships compound. People r eﬂect your behavior back to you. The\\nmore you help others, the mor e others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer\\nin each interaction can r esult in a network of br oad and str ong connections\\nover time.\\nNegative Compounding\\nStress compounds.  The frustration of a traﬃc jam. The weight of par enting\\nresponsibilities. The wor ry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high\\nblood pr essur e. By themselves, these common causes of str ess ar e\\nmanageable. But when they persist for years, little str esses compound into\\nserious health issues.\\nNegative thoughts compound. The mor e you think of yourself as worthless,\\nstupid, or ugly, the mor e you condition yourself to interpr et life that way . You\\nget trapped in a thought loop. The same is true for how you think about others.\\nOnce you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selﬁsh, you\\nsee those kind of people everywher e.\\nOutrage compounds. Riots, pr otests, and mass movements ar e rarely the\\nresult of a single event. Instead, a long series of micr oaggr essions and daily\\naggravations slowly multiply until one event tips the scales and outrage\\nspreads lik e wildﬁr e.\\nWHA T PROGRES S IS REALL Y LIKE\\nImagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in\\nfront of you. The room is cold and you can see your breath.\\nIt is currently twenty-ﬁve degrees. Ever so slowly , the room\\nbegins to heat up.\\nTwenty-six degrees.\\nTwenty-seven.\\nTwenty-eight.\\nThe ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.\\nTwenty-nine degrees.\\nThirty .\\nThirty-one.\\nStill, nothing has happened.\\nThen, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-\\ndegree shift, seemingly no diﬀerent from the temperature\\nincreases before it, has unlocked a huge change.\\nBreakthrough moments are often the result of many\\nprevious actions, which build up the potential required to\\nunleash a major change. This pattern shows up\\neverywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life\\nundetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo\\ncan barely be seen for the ﬁrst ﬁve years as it builds\\nextensive root systems underground before exploding\\nninety feet into the air within six weeks.\\nSimilarly , habits often appear to make no diﬀerence until\\nyou cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of\\nperformance. In the early and middle stages of any quest,\\nthere is often a V alley of Disappointment. Y ou expect to\\nmake progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how\\nineﬀective changes can seem during the ﬁrst days, weeks,\\nand even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going\\nanywhere. It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the\\nmost powerful outcomes are delayed.\\nThis is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build\\nhabits that last. P eople make a few small changes, fail to\\nsee a tangible result, and decide to stop. Y ou think, “I’ve\\nbeen running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any\\nchange in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over ,\\nit’s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order\\nto make a meaningful diﬀerence, habits need to persist\\nlong enough to break through this plateau—what I call the\\nPlateau of Latent P otential .\\nIf you ﬁnd yourself struggling to build a good habit or\\nbreak a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability\\nto improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the\\nPlateau of Latent P otential. Complaining about not\\nachieving success despite working hard is like complaining\\nabout an ice cube not melting when you heated it from\\ntwenty-ﬁve to thirty-one degrees. Y our work was not\\nwasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at\\nthirty-two degrees.\\nWhen you ﬁnally break through the Plateau of Latent\\nPotential, people will call it an overnight success. The\\noutside world only sees the most dramatic event rather\\nthan all that preceded it. But you know that it’s the work\\nyou did long ago—when it seemed that you weren’t making\\nany progress—that makes the jump today possible.\\nIt is the human equivalent of geological pressure. T wo\\ntectonic plates can grind against one another for millions of\\nyears, the tension slowly building all the while. Then, one\\nday, they rub each other once again, in the same fashion\\nthey have for ages, but this time the tension is too great. An\\nearthquake erupts. Change can take years—before it\\nhappens all at once.\\nMastery requires patience. The San Antonio Spurs, one\\nof the most successful teams in NBA history , have a quote\\nfrom social reformer Jacob Riis hanging in their locker\\nroom: “ When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a\\nstonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a\\nhundred times without as much as a crack showing in it.\\nYet at the hundred and ﬁrst blow it will split in two, and I\\nknow it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had\\ngone before.”\\nTHE PLA TEAU OF LA TENT POTENTIAL\\nFIGURE 2:  We often e xpect pr ogress to be linear . At the very\\nleast, we hope it will come quickly . In reality, the r esults of our\\neﬀorts ar e often delayed. It is not until months or years later\\nthat we r ealize the true value of the pr evious work we have\\ndone. This can r esult in a “ valley of disappointment” wher e\\npeople feel discouraged af ter putting in weeks or months of har d\\nwork without e xperiencing any r esults. However, this work was\\nnot wasted. It was simply being stor ed. It is not until much later\\nthat the full value of pr evious eﬀorts is r evealed.\\nAll big things come from small beginnings. The seed of\\nevery habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is\\nrepeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger . Roots\\nentrench themselves and branches grow . The task of\\nbreaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within\\nus. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating\\na delicate ﬂower one day at a time.\\nBut what determines whether we stick with a habit long\\nenough to survive the Plateau of Latent P otential and break\\nthrough to the other side? What is it that causes some\\npeople to slide into unwanted habits and enables others to\\nenjoy the compounding eﬀects of good ones?\\nFORGET ABOUT GO ALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD\\nPrevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what\\nwe want in life—getting into better shape, building a\\nsuccessful business, relaxing more and worrying less,\\nspending more time with friends and family—is to set\\nspeciﬁc, actionable goals.\\nFor many years, this was how I approached my habits,\\ntoo. Each one was a goal to be reached. I set goals for the\\ngrades I wanted to get in school, for the weights I wanted\\nto lift in the gym, for the proﬁts I wanted to earn in\\nbusiness. I succeeded at a few , but I failed at a lot of them.\\nEventually , I began to realize that my results had very little\\nto do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with\\nthe systems I followed.\\nWhat’s the diﬀerence between systems and goals? It’s a\\ndistinction I ﬁrst learned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist\\nbehind the Dilbert  comic. Goals are about the results you\\nwant to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead\\nto those results.\\nIf you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a\\nchampionship. Y our system is the way you recruit\\nplayers, manage your assistant coaches, and conduct\\npractice.\\nIf you’re an entrepreneur , your goal might be to build a\\nmillion-dollar business. Y our system is how you test\\nproduct ideas, hire employees, and run marketing\\ncampaigns.\\nIf you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new\\npiece. Y our system is how often you practice, how you\\nbreak down and tackle diﬀicult measures, and your\\nmethod for receiving feedback from your instructor .\\nNow for the interesting question: If you completely\\nignored your goals and focused only on your system, would\\nyou still succeed? F or example, if you were a basketball\\ncoach and you ignored your goal to win a championship\\nand focused only on what your team does at practice each\\nday, would you still get results?\\nI think you would.\\nThe goal in any sport is to ﬁnish with the best score, but\\nit would be ridiculous to spend the whole game staring at\\nthe scoreboard. The only way to actually win is to get\\nbetter each day . In the words of three-time Super Bowl\\nwinner Bill W alsh, “The score takes care of itself .” The\\nsame is true for other areas of life. If you want better\\nresults, then forget about setting goals. F ocus on your\\nsystem instead.\\nWhat do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless?\\nOf course not. Goals are good for setting a direction, but\\nsystems are best for making progress. A handful of\\nproblems arise when you spend too much time thinking\\nabout your goals and not enough time designing your\\nsystems.\\nProblem #1: W inners and losers have the same goals.\\nGoal setting suﬀers from a serious case of survivorship\\nbias. W e concentrate on the people who end up winning—\\nthe survivors—and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals\\nled to their success while overlooking all of the people who\\nhad the same objective but didn’t succeed.\\nEvery Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every\\ncandidate wants to get the job. And if successful and\\nunsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal\\ncannot be what diﬀerentiates the winners from the losers.\\nIt wasn’t the goal of winning the T our de France that\\npropelled the British cyclists to the top of the sport.\\nPresumably , they had wanted to win the race every year\\nbefore—just like every other professional team. The goal\\nhad always been there. It was only when they implemented\\na system  of continuous small improvements that they\\nachieved a diﬀerent outcome.\\nProblem #2: A chieving a goal is only a momentary change.\\nImagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean\\nit. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have\\na clean room—for now . But if you maintain the same sloppy ,\\npack -rat habits that led to a messy room in the ﬁrst place,\\nsoon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping\\nfor another burst of motivation. Y ou’re left chasing the\\nsame outcome because you never changed the system\\nbehind it. Y ou treated a symptom without addressing the\\ncause.\\nAchieving a goal only changes your life for the moment .\\nThat’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. W e\\nthink we need to change our results, but the results are not\\nthe problem. What we really need to change are the\\nsystems that cause those results. When you solve problems\\nat the results level, you only solve them temporarily . In\\norder to improve for good, you need to solve problems at\\nthe systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will ﬁx\\nthemselves.\\nProblem #3: Goals r estrict your happiness.\\nThe implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I\\nreach my goal, then I’ll be happy .” The problem with a\\ngoals-ﬁrst mentality is that you’re continually putting\\nhappiness oﬀ until the next milestone. I’ve slipped into this\\ntrap so many times I’ve lost count. F or years, happiness\\nwas always something for my future self to enjoy . I\\npromised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of\\nmuscle or after my business was featured in the New Y ork\\nTimes , then I could ﬁnally relax.\\nFurthermore, goals create an “either-or” conﬂict: either\\nyou achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and\\nyou are a disappointment. Y ou mentally box yourself into a\\nnarrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is\\nunlikely that your actual path through life will match the\\nexact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes\\nno sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when\\nthere are many paths to success.\\nA systems-ﬁrst mentality provides the antidote. When\\nyou fall in love with the process rather than the product,\\nyou don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be\\nhappy . You can be satisﬁed anytime your system is running.\\nAnd a system can be successful in many diﬀerent forms,\\nnot just the one you ﬁrst envision.\\nProblem #4: Goals ar e at odds with long-ter m progress.\\nFinally , a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” eﬀect.\\nMany runners work hard for months, but as soon as they\\ncross the ﬁnish line, they stop training. The race is no\\nlonger there to motivate them. When all of your hard work\\nis focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you\\nforward after you achieve it? This is why many people ﬁnd\\nthemselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing\\na goal.\\nThe purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The\\npurpose of building systems is to continue playing the\\ngame. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not\\nabout any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of\\nendless reﬁnement and continuous improvement.\\nUltimately , it is your commitment to the process  that will\\ndetermine your progress .\\nA SYSTEM OF A TOMIC HABITS\\nIf you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem\\nisn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat\\nthemselves again and again not because you don’t want to\\nchange, but because you have the wrong system for\\nchange.\\nYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the\\nlevel of your systems.\\nFocusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal,\\nis one of the core themes of this book. It is also one of the\\ndeeper meanings behind the word atomic . By now , you’ve\\nprobably realized that an atomic habit refers to a tiny\\nchange, a marginal gain, a 1 percent improvement. But\\natomic habits are not just any old habits, however small.\\nThey are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just\\nas atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic\\nhabits are the building blocks of remarkable results.\\nHabits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a\\nfundamental unit that contributes to your overall\\nimprovement. A t ﬁrst, these tiny routines seem\\ninsigniﬁcant, but soon they build on each other and fuel\\nbigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the\\ncost of their initial investment. They are both small and\\nmighty . This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits —a\\nregular practice or routine that is not only small and easy\\nto do, but also the source of incredible power; a component\\nof the system of compound growth.\\nChapter Summary\\nHabits are the compound interest of self -improvement.\\nGetting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in\\nthe long-run.\\nHabits are a double-edged sword. They can work for\\nyou or against you, which is why understanding the\\ndetails is essential.\\nSmall changes often appear to make no diﬀerence until\\nyou cross a critical threshold. The most powerful\\noutcomes of any compounding process are delayed.\\nYou need to be patient.\\nAn atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger\\nsystem. Just as atoms are the building blocks of\\nmolecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of\\nremarkable results.\\nIf you want better results, then forget about setting\\ngoals. F ocus on your system instead.\\nYou do not rise to the level of your goals. Y ou fall to the\\nlevel of your systems.\\nW\\n2\\nHow Y our Habits Shape Y our Identity (and V ice Versa)\\nHY IS IT so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to\\nform good ones? F ew things can have a more\\npowerful impact on your life than improving your daily\\nhabits. And yet it is likely that this time next year you’ll be\\ndoing the same thing rather than something better .\\nIt often feels diﬀicult to keep good habits going for more\\nthan a few days, even with sincere eﬀort and the occasional\\nburst of motivation. Habits like exercise, meditation,\\njournaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two and\\nthen become a hassle.\\nHowever , once your habits are established, they seem to\\nstick around forever—especially the unwanted ones.\\nDespite our best intentions, unhealthy habits like eating\\njunk food, watching too much television, procrastinating,\\nand smoking can feel impossible to break.\\nChanging our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1)\\nwe try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change\\nour habits in the wrong way . In this chapter , I’ll address the\\nﬁrst point. In the chapters that follow , I’ll answer the\\nsecond.\\nOur ﬁrst mistake is that we try to change the wrong\\nthing. T o understand what I mean, consider that there are\\nthree levels at which change can occur . You can imagine\\nthem like the layers of an onion.\\nTHREE LA YERS OF BEHA VIOR CHANGE\\nFIGURE 3:  Ther e are three layers of behavior change: a change\\nin your outcomes, a change in your pr ocesses, or a change in\\nyour identity .\\nThe ﬁrst layer is changing your outcomes.  This level\\nis concerned with changing your results: losing weight,\\npublishing a book, winning a championship. Most of the\\ngoals you set are associated with this level of change.\\nThe second layer is changing your process.  This\\nlevel is concerned with changing your habits and systems:\\nimplementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your\\ndesk for better workﬂow , developing a meditation practice.\\nMost of the habits you build are associated with this level.\\nThe third and deepest layer is changing your\\nidentity . This level is concerned with changing your\\nbeliefs: your worldview , your self -image, your judgments\\nabout yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions,\\nand biases you hold are associated with this level.\\nOutcomes are about what you get. Processes are about\\nwhat you do . Identity is about what you believe. When it\\ncomes to building habits that last—when it comes to\\nbuilding a system of 1 percent improvements—the problem\\nis not that one level is “better” or “worse” than another . All\\nlevels of change are useful in their own way . The problem is\\nthe direction  of change.\\nMany people begin the process of changing their habits\\nby focusing on what  they want to achieve. This leads us to\\noutcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-\\nbased habits. W ith this approach, we start by focusing on\\nwho we wish to become.\\nOUTCOME-BASED HABITS\\nIDENTITY -BASED HABITS\\nFIGURE 4:  With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you\\nwant to achieve. W ith identity -based habits, the focus is on who\\nyou wish to become.\\nImagine two people resisting a cigarette. When oﬀered a\\nsmoke, the ﬁrst person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to\\nquit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person\\nstill believes they are a smoker who is trying to be\\nsomething else. They are hoping their behavior will change\\nwhile carrying around the same beliefs.\\nThe second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m\\nnot a smoker .” It’s a small diﬀerence, but this statement\\nsignals a shift in identity . Smoking was part of their former\\nlife, not their current one. They no longer identify as\\nsomeone who smokes.\\nMost people don’t even consider identity change when\\nthey set out to improve. They just think, “I want to be\\nskinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I’ll be\\nskinny (process).” They set goals and determine the actions\\nthey should take to achieve those goals without considering\\nthe beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way\\nthey look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their\\nold identity can sabotage their new plans for change.\\nBehind every system of actions are a system of beliefs.\\nThe system of a democracy is founded on beliefs like\\nfreedom, majority rule, and social equality . The system of a\\ndictatorship has a very diﬀerent set of beliefs like absolute\\nauthority and strict obedience. Y ou can imagine many ways\\nto try to get more people to vote in a democracy , but such\\nbehavior change would never get oﬀ the ground in a\\ndictatorship. That’s not the identity of the system. V oting is\\na behavior that is impossible under a certain set of beliefs.\\nA similar pattern exists whether we are discussing\\nindividuals, organizations, or societies. There are a set of\\nbeliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an identity\\nbehind the habits.\\nBehavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.\\nYou may want more money , but if your identity is someone\\nwho consumes rather than creates, then you’ll continue to\\nbe pulled toward spending rather than earning. Y ou may\\nwant better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort\\nover accomplishment, you’ll be drawn to relaxing rather\\nthan training. It’s hard to change your habits if you never\\nchange the underlying beliefs that led to your past\\nbehavior . You have a new goal and a new plan, but you\\nhaven’t changed who you are.\\nThe story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder ,\\nColorado, provides a good example. “F or as long as I can\\nremember , I’ve chewed my ﬁngernails,” Clark told me. “It\\nstarted as a nervous habit when I was young, and then\\nmorphed into an undesirable grooming ritual. One day , I\\nresolved to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit.\\nThrough mindful willpower alone, I managed to do it.”\\nThen, Clark did something surprising.\\n“I asked my wife to schedule my ﬁrst-ever manicure,” he\\nsaid. “My thought was that if I started paying to maintain\\nmy nails, I wouldn’t chew them. And it worked, but not for\\nthe monetary reason. What happened was the manicure\\nmade my ﬁngers look really nice for the ﬁrst time. The\\nmanicurist even said that—other than the chewing—I had\\nreally healthy , attractive nails. Suddenly , I was proud of my\\nﬁngernails. And even though that’s something I had never\\naspired to, it made all the diﬀerence. I’ve never chewed my\\nnails since; not even a single close call. And it’s because I\\nnow take pride in properly caring for them.”\\nThe ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit\\nbecomes part of your identity . It’s one thing to say I’m the\\ntype of person who wants  this. It’s something very diﬀerent\\nto say I’m the type of person who is this.\\nThe more pride you have in a particular aspect of your\\nidentity , the more motivated you will be to maintain the\\nhabits associated with it. If you’re proud of how your hair\\nlooks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and\\nmaintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll\\nmake sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re\\nproud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend\\nhours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved,\\nyou’ll ﬁght tooth and nail to maintain your habits.\\nTrue behavior change is identity change. Y ou might start\\na habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll\\nstick with one is that it becomes part of your identity .\\nAnyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat\\nhealthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief\\nbehind the behavior , then it is hard to stick with long-term\\nchanges. Improvements are only temporary until they\\nbecome part of who you are.\\nThe goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become  a\\nreader .\\nThe goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to\\nbecome  a runner .\\nThe goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to\\nbecome  a musician.\\nYour behaviors are usually a reﬂection of your identity .\\nWhat you do is an indication of the type of person you\\nbelieve that you are—either consciously or nonconsciously .*\\nResearch has shown that once a person believes in a\\nparticular aspect of their identity , they are more likely to\\nact in alignment with that belief . For example, people who\\nidentiﬁed as “being a voter” were more likely to vote than\\nthose who simply claimed “voting” was an action they\\nwanted to perform. Similarly , the person who incorporates\\nexercise into their identity doesn’t have to convince\\nthemselves to train. Doing the right thing is easy . After all,\\nwhen your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you\\nare no longer pursuing behavior change. Y ou are simply\\nacting like the type of person you already believe yourself\\nto be.\\nLike all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-\\nedged sword. When working for you, identity change can\\nbe a powerful force for self -improvement. When working\\nagainst you, though, identity change can be a curse. Once\\nyou have adopted an identity , it can be easy to let your\\nallegiance to it impact your ability to change. Many people\\nwalk through life in a cognitive slumber , blindly following\\nthe norms attached to their identity .\\n“I’m terrible with directions.”\\n“I’m not a morning person.”\\n“I’m bad at remembering people’s names.”\\n“I’m always late.”\\n“I’m not good with technology .”\\n“I’m horrible at math.”\\n. . . and a thousand other variations.\\nWhen you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it\\nis easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them\\nas a fact. In time, you begin to resist certain actions\\nbecause “that’s not who I am.” There is internal pressure to\\nmaintain your self -image and behave in a way that is\\nconsistent with your beliefs. Y ou ﬁnd whatever way you can\\nto avoid contradicting yourself .\\nThe more deeply a thought or action is tied to your\\nidentity , the more diﬀicult it is to change it. It can feel\\ncomfortable to believe what your culture believes (group\\nidentity) or to do what upholds your self -image (personal\\nidentity), even if it’s wrong. The biggest barrier to positive\\nchange at any level—individual, team, society—is identity\\nconﬂict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they\\nconﬂict with your identity , you will fail to put them into\\naction.\\nOn any given day , you may struggle with your habits\\nbecause you’re too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or\\nhundreds of other reasons. Over the long run, however , the\\nreal reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self -\\nimage gets in the way . This is why you can’t get too\\nattached to one version of your identity . Progress requires\\nunlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires\\nyou to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and\\nexpand your identity .\\nThis brings us to an important question: If your beliefs\\nand worldview play such an important role in your\\nbehavior , where do they come from in the ﬁrst place? How ,\\nexactly , is your identity formed? And how can you\\nemphasize new aspects of your identity that serve you and\\ngradually erase the pieces that hinder you?\\nTHE TWO -STEP PROCES S TO CHANGING Y OUR\\nIDENTITY\\nYour identity emerges out of your habits. Y ou are not born\\nwith preset beliefs. Every belief , including those about\\nyourself , is learned and conditioned through experience. *\\nMore precisely , your habits are how you embody  your\\nidentity . When you make your bed each day , you embody\\nthe identity of an organized person. When you write each\\nday, you embody the identity of a creative person. When\\nyou train each day , you embody the identity of an athletic\\nperson.\\nThe more you repeat a behavior , the more you reinforce\\nthe identity associated with that behavior . In fact, the word\\nidentity  was originally derived from the Latin words\\nessentitas , which means being,  and identidem , which\\nmeans repeatedly . Your identity is literally your “repeated\\nbeingness.”\\nWhatever your identity is right now , you only believe it\\nbecause you have proof of it. If you go to church every\\nSunday for twenty years, you have evidence that you are\\nreligious. If you study biology for one hour every night, you\\nhave evidence that you are studious. If you go to the gym\\neven when it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are\\ncommitted to ﬁtness. The more evidence you have for a\\nbelief , the more strongly you will believe it.\\nFor most of my early life, I didn’t consider myself a\\nwriter . If you were to ask any of my high school teachers or\\ncollege professors, they would tell you I was an average\\nwriter at best: certainly not a standout. When I began my\\nwriting career , I published a new article every Monday and\\nThursday for the ﬁrst few years. As the evidence grew , so\\ndid my identity as a writer . I didn’t start out as a writer . I\\nbecame  one through my habits.\\nOf course, your habits are not the only actions that\\ninﬂuence your identity , but by virtue of their frequency they\\nare usually the most important ones. Each experience in\\nlife modiﬁes your self -image, but it’s unlikely you would\\nconsider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball\\nonce or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you\\nrepeat these actions, however , the evidence accumulates\\nand your self -image begins to change. The eﬀect of one-oﬀ\\nexperiences tends to fade away while the eﬀect of habits\\ngets reinforced with time, which means your habits\\ncontribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity .\\nIn this way , the process of building habits is actually the\\nprocess of becoming yourself .\\nThis is a gradual evolution. W e do not change by\\nsnapping our ﬁngers and deciding to be someone entirely\\nnew. We change bit by bit, day by day , habit by habit. W e\\nare continually undergoing microevolutions of the self .\\nEach habit is like a suggestion: “Hey , maybe this is who I\\nam.” If you ﬁnish a book, then perhaps you are the type of\\nperson who likes reading. If you go to the gym, then\\nperhaps you are the type of person who likes exercise. If\\nyou practice playing the guitar , perhaps you are the type of\\nperson who likes music.\\nEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you\\nwish to become. No single instance will transform your\\nbeliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of\\nyour new identity . This is one reason why meaningful\\nchange does not require radical change. Small habits can\\nmake a meaningful diﬀerence by providing evidence of a\\nnew identity . And if a change is meaningful, it actually is\\nbig. That’s the paradox of making small improvements.\\nPutting this all together , you can see that habits are the\\npath to changing your identity . The most practical way to\\nchange who you are is to change what  you do .\\nEach time you write a page, you are a writer .\\nEach time you practice the violin, you are a musician.\\nEach time you start a workout, you are an athlete.\\nEach time you encourage your employees, you are a\\nleader .\\nEach habit not only gets results but also teaches you\\nsomething far more important: to trust yourself . You start\\nto believe you can actually accomplish these things. When\\nthe votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the\\nstory you tell yourself begins to change as well.\\nOf course, it works the opposite way , too. Every time you\\nchoose to perform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity .\\nThe good news is that you don’t need to be perfect. In any\\nelection, there are going to be votes for both sides. Y ou\\ndon’t need a unanimous vote to win an election; you just\\nneed a majority . It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for\\na bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Y our goal is\\nsimply to win the majority of the time.\\nNew identities require new evidence. If you keep casting\\nthe same votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the\\nsame results you’ve always had. If nothing changes,\\nnothing is going to change.\\nIt is a simple two-step process:\\n1. Decide the type of person you want to be.\\n2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.\\nFirst, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level\\n—as an individual, as a team, as a community , as a nation.\\nWhat do you want to stand for? What are your principles\\nand values? Who do you wish to become?\\nThese are big questions, and many people aren’t sure\\nwhere to begin—but they do know what kind of results they\\nwant: to get six -pack abs or to feel less anxious or to double\\ntheir salary . That’s ﬁne. Start there and work backward\\nfrom the results you want to the type of person who could\\nget those results. Ask yourself , “Who is the type of person\\nthat could get the outcome I want?” Who is the type of\\nperson that could lose forty pounds? Who is the type of\\nperson that could learn a new language? Who is the type of\\nperson that could run a successful start-up?\\nFor example, “ Who is the type of person who could write\\na book?” It’s probably someone who is consistent and\\nreliable. Now your focus shifts from writing a book\\n(outcome-based) to being the type of person who is\\nconsistent and reliable (identity-based).\\nThis process can lead to beliefs like:\\n“I’m the kind of teacher who stands up for her\\nstudents.”\\n“I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time\\nand empathy they need.”\\n“I’m the kind of manager who advocates for her\\nemployees.”\\nOnce you have a handle on the type of person you want\\nto be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your\\ndesired identity . I have a friend who lost over 100 pounds\\nby asking herself , “What would a healthy person do?” All\\nday long, she would use this question as a guide. W ould a\\nhealthy person walk or take a cab? W ould a healthy person\\norder a burrito or a salad? She ﬁgured if she acted like a\\nhealthy person long enough, eventually she would become\\nthat person. She was right.\\nThe concept of identity-based habits is our ﬁrst\\nintroduction to another key theme in this book: feedback\\nloops. Y our habits shape your identity , and your identity\\nshapes your habits. It’s a two-way street. The formation of\\nall habits is a feedback loop (a concept we will explore in\\ndepth in the next chapter), but it’s important to let your\\nvalues, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than\\nyour results. The focus should always be on becoming that\\ntype of person, not getting a particular outcome.\\nTHE REAL REASON HABITS MA TTER\\nIdentity change is the North Star of habit change. The\\nremainder of this book will provide you with step-by-step\\ninstructions on how to build better habits in yourself , your\\nfamily , your team, your company , and anywhere else you\\nwish. But the true question is: “ Are you becoming the type\\nof person you want to become?” The ﬁrst step is not what\\nor how, but who. You need to know who you want to be.\\nOtherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a\\nrudder . And that’s why we are starting here.\\nYou have the power to change your beliefs about\\nyourself . Your identity is not set in stone. Y ou have a choice\\nin every moment. Y ou can choose the identity you want to\\nreinforce today with the habits you choose today . And this\\nbrings us to the deeper purpose of this book and the real\\nreason habits matter .\\nBuilding better habits isn’t about littering your day with\\nlife hacks. It’s not about ﬂossing one tooth each night or\\ntaking a cold shower each morning or wearing the same\\noutﬁt each day . It’s not about achieving external measures\\nof success like earning more money , losing weight, or\\nreducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all of these\\nthings, but fundamentally they are not about having\\nsomething. They are about becoming  someone.\\nUltimately , your habits matter because they help you\\nbecome the type of person you wish to be. They are the\\nchannel through which you develop your deepest beliefs\\nabout yourself . Quite literally , you become your habits.\\nChapter Summary\\nThere are three levels of change: outcome change,\\nprocess change, and identity change.\\nThe most eﬀective way to change your habits is to\\nfocus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you\\nwish to become.\\nYour identity emerges out of your habits. Every action\\nis a vote for the type of person you wish to become.\\nBecoming the best version of yourself requires you to\\ncontinuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and\\nexpand your identity .\\nThe real reason habits matter is not because they can\\nget you better results (although they can do that), but\\nbecause they can change your beliefs about yourself .\\nI\\n3\\nHow to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps\\nN 1898 , A psychologist named Edward Thorndike\\nconducted an experiment that would lay the foundation\\nfor our understanding of how habits form and the rules that\\nguide our behavior . Thorndike was interested in studying\\nthe behavior of animals, and he started by working with\\ncats.\\nHe would place each cat inside a device known as a\\npuzzle box. The box was designed so that the cat could\\nescape through a door “ by some simple act, such as pulling\\nat a loop of cord, pressing a lever , or stepping on a\\nplatform.” F or example, one box contained a lever that,\\nwhen pressed, would open a door on the side of the box.\\nOnce the door had been opened, the cat could dart out and\\nrun over to a bowl of food.\\nMost cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed\\ninside the box. They would poke their nose into the corners,\\nstick their paws through openings, and claw at loose\\nobjects. A fter a few minutes of exploration, the cats would\\nhappen to press the magical lever , the door would open,\\nand they would escape.\\nThorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many\\ntrials. In the beginning, the animals moved around the box\\nat random. But as soon as the lever had been pressed and\\nthe door opened, the process of learning began. Gradually ,\\neach cat learned to associate the action of pressing the\\nlever with the reward of escaping the box and getting to\\nthe food.\\nAfter twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so\\nautomatic and habitual that the cat could escape within a\\nfew seconds. F or example, Thorndike noted, “Cat 12 took\\nthe following times to perform the act. 160 seconds, 30\\nseconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20, 12,\\n10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.”\\nDuring the ﬁrst three trials, the cat escaped in an\\naverage of 1.5 minutes. During the last three trials, it\\nescaped in an average of 6.3 seconds. W ith practice, each\\ncat made fewer errors and their actions became quicker\\nand more automatic. R ather than repeat the same\\nmistakes, the cat began to cut straight to the solution.\\nFrom his studies, Thorndike described the learning\\nprocess by stating, “ behaviors followed by satisfying\\nconsequences tend to be repeated and those that produce\\nunpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.”\\nHis work provides the perfect starting point for discussing\\nhow habits form in our own lives. It also provides answers\\nto some fundamental questions like: What are habits? And\\nwhy does the brain bother building them at all?\\nWHY Y OUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS\\nA habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times\\nto become automatic. The process of habit formation\\nbegins with trial and error . Whenever you encounter a new\\nsituation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do\\nI respond to this?  The ﬁrst time you come across a\\nproblem, you’re not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike’s\\ncat, you’re just trying things out to see what works.\\nNeurological activity in the brain is high during this\\nperiod. Y ou are carefully analyzing the situation and\\nmaking conscious decisions about how to act. Y ou’re taking\\nin tons of new information and trying to make sense of it\\nall. The brain is busy learning the most eﬀective course of\\naction.\\nOccasionally , like a cat pressing on a lever , you stumble\\nacross a solution. Y ou’re feeling anxious, and you discover\\nthat going for a run calms you down. Y ou’re mentally\\nexhausted from a long day of work, and you learn that\\nplaying video games relaxes you. Y ou’re exploring,\\nexploring, exploring, and then—BAM—a reward.\\nAfter you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter\\nyour strategy for next time. Y our brain immediately begins\\nto catalog the events that preceded the reward. Wait a\\nminute—that felt good. What did I do right before that?\\nThis is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try ,\\nfail, learn, try diﬀerently . With practice, the useless\\nmovements fade away and the useful actions get\\nreinforced. That’s a habit forming.\\nWhenever you face a problem repeatedly , your brain\\nbegins to automate the process of solving it. Y our habits\\nare just a series of automatic solutions that solve the\\nproblems and stresses you face regularly . As behavioral\\nscientist Jason Hreha writes, “ Habits are, simply , reliable\\nsolutions to recurring problems in our environment.”\\nAs habits are created, the level of activity in the brain\\ndecreases . You learn to lock in on the cues that predict\\nsuccess and tune out everything else. When a similar\\nsituation arises in the future, you know exactly what to look\\nfor. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a\\nsituation. Y our brain skips the process of trial and error and\\ncreates a mental rule: if this, then that. These cognitive\\nscripts can be followed automatically whenever the\\nsituation is appropriate. Now , whenever you feel stressed,\\nyou get the itch to run. As soon as you walk in the door\\nfrom work, you grab the video game controller . A choice\\nthat once required eﬀort is now automatic. A habit has\\nbeen created.\\nHabits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In\\na sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously\\nfollowed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the\\nconditions are right, you can draw on this memory and\\nautomatically apply the same solution. The primary reason\\nthe brain remembers the past is to better predict what will\\nwork in the future.\\nHabit formation is incredibly useful because the\\nconscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only\\npay attention to one problem at a time. As a result, your\\nbrain is always working to preserve your conscious\\nattention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever\\npossible, the conscious mind likes to pawn oﬀ tasks to the\\nnonconscious mind to do automatically . This is precisely\\nwhat happens when a habit is formed. Habits reduce\\ncognitive load and free up mental capacity , so you can\\nallocate your attention to other tasks.\\nDespite their eﬀiciency , some people still wonder about\\nthe beneﬁts of habits. The argument goes like this: “ Will\\nhabits make my life dull? I don’t want to pigeonhole myself\\ninto a lifestyle I don’t enjoy . Doesn’t so much routine take\\naway the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?” Hardly . Such\\nquestions set up a false dichotomy . They make you think\\nthat you have to choose between building habits and\\nattaining freedom. In reality , the two complement each\\nother .\\nHabits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact,\\nthe people who don’t have their habits handled are often\\nthe ones with the least  amount of freedom. W ithout good\\nﬁnancial habits, you will always be struggling for the next\\ndollar . Without good health habits, you will always seem to\\nbe short on energy . Without good learning habits, you will\\nalways feel like you’re behind the curve. If you’re always\\nbeing forced to make decisions about simple tasks—when\\nshould I work out, where do I go to write, when do I pay\\nthe bills—then you have less time for freedom. It’s only by\\nmaking the fundamentals of life easier that you can create\\nthe mental space needed for free thinking and creativity .\\nConversely , when you have your habits dialed in and the\\nbasics of life are handled and done, your mind is free to\\nfocus on new challenges and master the next set of\\nproblems. Building habits in the present allows you to do\\nmore of what you want in the future.\\nTHE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK\\nThe process of building a habit can be divided into four\\nsimple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. *\\nBreaking it down into these fundamental parts can help us\\nunderstand what a habit is, how it works, and how to\\nimprove it.\\nFIGURE 5:  All habits pr oceed thr ough four stages in the same\\norder: cue, craving, r esponse, and r ewar d.\\nThis four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit, and\\nyour brain runs through these steps in the same order each\\ntime.\\nFirst, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to\\ninitiate a behavior . It is a bit of information that predicts a\\nreward. Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to\\ncues that signaled the location of primary rewards like\\nfood, water , and sex. T oday, we spend most of our time\\nlearning cues that predict secondary rewards like money\\nand fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and\\nfriendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Of course,\\nthese pursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival\\nand reproduction, which is the deeper motive behind\\neverything we do .)\\nYour mind is continuously analyzing your internal and\\nexternal environment for hints of where rewards are\\nlocated. Because the cue is the ﬁrst indication that we’re\\nclose to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving.\\nCravings are the second step, and they are the\\nmotivational force behind every habit. W ithout some level\\nof motivation or desire—without craving a change—we\\nhave no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself\\nbut the change in state it delivers. Y ou do not crave\\nsmoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it\\nprovides. Y ou are not motivated by brushing your teeth but\\nrather by the feeling of a clean mouth. Y ou do not want to\\nturn on the television, you want to be entertained. Every\\ncraving is linked to a desire to change your internal state.\\nThis is an important point that we will discuss in detail\\nlater.\\nCravings diﬀer from person to person. In theory , any\\npiece of information could trigger a craving, but in\\npractice, people are not motivated by the same cues. F or a\\ngambler , the sound of slot machines can be a potent trigger\\nthat sparks an intense wave of desire. F or someone who\\nrarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are\\njust background noise. Cues are meaningless until they are\\ninterpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the\\nobserver are what transform a cue into a craving.\\nThe third step is the response. The response is the actual\\nhabit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or\\nan action. Whether a response occurs depends on how\\nmotivated you are and how much friction is associated with\\nthe behavior . If a particular action requires more physical\\nor mental eﬀort than you are willing to expend, then you\\nwon’t do it. Y our response also depends on your ability . It\\nsounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable\\nof doing it. If you want to dunk a basketball but can’t jump\\nhigh enough to reach the hoop, well, you’re out of luck.\\nFinally , the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the\\nend goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the\\nreward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The\\nresponse is about obtaining the reward. W e chase rewards\\nbecause they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2)\\nthey teach us.\\nThe ﬁrst purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving .\\nYes, rewards provide beneﬁts on their own. F ood and water\\ndeliver the energy you need to survive. Getting a promotion\\nbrings more money and respect. Getting in shape improves\\nyour health and your dating prospects. But the more\\nimmediate beneﬁt is that rewards satisfy your craving to\\neat or to gain status or to win approval. A t least for a\\nmoment, rewards deliver contentment and relief from\\ncraving.\\nSecond, rewards teach us which actions are worth\\nremembering in the future. Y our brain is a reward detector .\\nAs you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is\\ncontinuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires\\nand deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and\\ndisappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that\\nhelps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless\\nones. Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the\\nhabit cycle.\\nIf a behavior is insuﬀicient in any of the four stages, it\\nwill not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit\\nwill never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t\\nexperience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior\\ndiﬀicult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward\\nfails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do\\nit again in the future. W ithout the ﬁrst three steps, a\\nbehavior will not occur . Without all four , a behavior will not\\nbe repeated.\\nTHE HABIT L OOP\\nFIGURE 6:  The four stages of habit ar e best described as a\\nfeedback loop. They for m an endless cycle that is running every\\nmoment you ar e alive. This “habit loop” is continually scanning\\nthe envir onment, pr edicting what will happen ne xt, trying out\\ndiﬀer ent responses, and lear ning fr om the r esults. *\\nIn summary , the cue triggers a craving, which motivates\\na response, which provides a reward, which satisﬁes the\\ncraving and, ultimately , becomes associated with the cue.\\nTogether , these four steps form a neurological feedback\\nloop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving,\\nresponse, reward—that ultimately allows you to create\\nautomatic habits. This cycle is known as the habit loop.\\nThis four-step process is not something that happens\\noccasionally , but rather it is an endless feedback loop that\\nis running and active during every moment you are alive—\\neven now . The brain is continually scanning the\\nenvironment, predicting what will happen next, trying out\\ndiﬀerent responses, and learning from the results. The\\nentire process is completed in a split second, and we use it\\nagain and again without realizing everything that has been\\npacked into the previous moment.\\nWe can split these four steps into two phases: the\\nproblem phase and the solution phase. The problem phase\\nincludes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize\\nthat something needs to change. The solution phase\\nincludes the response and the reward, and it is when you\\ntake action and achieve the change you desire.\\nProblem phase\\n1. Cue\\n2. Craving\\nSolution phase\\n3. Response\\n4. Reward\\nAll behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem.\\nSometimes the problem is that you notice something good\\nand you want to obtain it. Sometimes the problem is that\\nyou are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it. Either\\nway, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you\\nface.\\nIn the table on the following page, you can see a few\\nexamples of what this looks like in real life.\\nImagine walking into a dark room and ﬂipping on the\\nlight switch. Y ou have performed this simple habit so many\\ntimes that it occurs without thinking. Y ou proceed through\\nall four stages in the fraction of a second. The urge to act\\nstrikes you without thinking.\\nProblem phase\\n1. Cue:  Your phone buzzes with a new te xt message.\\n2. Craving:  You want to lear n the contents of the message.\\nSolution phase\\n3. Response:  You grab your phone and r ead the te xt.\\n4. Reward:  You satisf y your craving to r ead the message. Grabbing your\\nphone becomes associated with your phone buzzing.\\nProblem phase\\n1. Cue:  You ar e answering emails.\\n2. Craving:  You begin to feel str essed and overwhelmed by work. Y ou want to\\nfeel in contr ol.\\nSolution phase\\n3. Response:  You bite your nails.\\n4. Reward:  You satisf y your craving to r educe str ess. Biting your nails\\nbecomes associated with answering email.\\nProblem phase\\n1. Cue:  You wak e up.\\n2. Craving:  You want to feel alert.\\nSolution phase\\n3. Response:  You drink a cup of coﬀee.\\n4. Reward:  You satisf y your craving to feel alert. Drinking coﬀee becomes\\nassociated with waking up.\\nProblem phase\\n1. Cue:  You smell a doughnut shop as you walk down the str eet near your\\noﬃce.\\n2. Craving:  You begin to crave a doughnut.\\nSolution phase\\n3. Response:  You buy a doughnut and eat it.\\n4. Reward:  You satisf y your craving to eat a doughnut. Buying a doughnut\\nbecomes associated with walking down the str eet near your oﬃce.\\nProblem phase\\n1. Cue:  You hit a stumbling block on a pr oject at work.\\n2. Craving:  You feel stuck and want to r elieve your frustration.\\nSolution phase\\n3. Response:  You pull out your phone and check social media.\\n4. Reward:  You satisf y your craving to feel r elieved. Checking social media\\nbecomes associated with feeling stalled at work.\\nProblem phase\\n1. Cue:  You walk into a dark r oom.\\n2. Craving:  You want to be able to see.\\nSolution phase\\n3. Response:  You ﬂip the light switch.\\n4. Reward:  You satisf y your craving to see. T urning on the light switch\\nbecomes associated with being in a dark r oom.\\nBy the time we become adults, we rarely notice the\\nhabits that are running our lives. Most of us never give a\\nsecond thought to the fact that we tie the same shoe ﬁrst\\neach morning, or unplug the toaster after each use, or\\nalways change into comfortable clothes after getting home\\nfrom work. A fter decades of mental programming, we\\nautomatically slip into these patterns of thinking and\\nacting.\\nTHE FOUR LA WS OF BEHA VIOR CHANGE\\nIn the following chapters, we will see time and again how\\nthe four stages of cue, craving, response, and reward\\ninﬂuence nearly everything we do each day . But before we\\ndo that, we need to transform these four steps into a\\npractical framework that we can use to design good habits\\nand eliminate bad ones.\\nI refer to this framework as the Four Laws of Behavior\\nChange , and it provides a simple set of rules for creating\\ngood habits and breaking bad ones. Y ou can think of each\\nlaw as a lever that inﬂuences human behavior . When the\\nlevers are in the right positions, creating good habits is\\neﬀortless. When they are in the wrong positions, it is nearly\\nimpossible.\\nHow to Create a Good Habit\\nThe 1st law (Cue):  Make it obvious.\\nThe 2nd law (Craving):  Make it attractive.\\nThe 3rd law (Response):  Make it easy .\\nThe 4th law (Reward):  Make it satisf ying.\\nWe can invert these laws to learn how to break a bad\\nhabit.\\nHow to Break a Bad Habit\\nInversion of the 1st law (Cue):  Make it invisible.\\nInversion of the 2nd law (Craving):  Make it unattractive.\\nInversion of the 3rd law (Response):  Make it diﬃcult.\\nInversion of the 4th law (Reward):  Make it unsatisf ying.\\nIt would be irresponsible for me to claim that these four\\nlaws are an exhaustive framework for changing any human\\nbehavior , but I think they’re close. As you will soon see, the\\nFour Laws of Behavior Change apply to nearly every ﬁeld,\\nfrom sports to politics, art to medicine, comedy to\\nmanagement. These laws can be used no matter what\\nchallenge you are facing. There is no need for completely\\ndiﬀerent strategies for each habit.\\nWhenever you want to change your behavior , you can\\nsimply ask yourself:\\n1. How can I make it obvious?\\n2. How can I make it attractive?\\n3. How can I make it easy?\\n4. How can I make it satisfying?\\nIf you have ever wondered, “ Why don’t I do what I say\\nI’m going to do? Why don’t I lose the weight or stop\\nsmoking or save for retirement or start that side business?\\nWhy do I say something is important but never seem to\\nmake time for it?” The answers to those questions can be\\nfound somewhere in these four laws. The key to creating\\ngood habits and breaking bad ones is to understand these\\nfundamental laws and how to alter them to your\\nspeciﬁcations. Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against\\nthe grain of human nature.\\nYour habits are shaped by the systems in your life. In the\\nchapters that follow , we will discuss these laws one by one\\nand show how you can use them to create a system in\\nwhich good habits emerge naturally and bad habits wither\\naway .\\nChapter Summary\\nA habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough\\ntimes to become automatic.\\nThe ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems\\nof life with as little energy and eﬀort as possible.\\nAny habit can be broken down into a feedback loop\\nthat involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and\\nreward.\\nThe F our Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of\\nrules we can use to build better habits. They are (1)\\nmake it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy ,\\nand (4) make it satisfying.\\nTHE 1ST LA W\\nMake It Obvious\\n4\\nThe Man Who Didn’t L ook Right\\nTHE PSY CHOLOGIST GARY Klein once told me a story about a\\nwoman who attended a family gathering. She had spent\\nyears working as a paramedic and, upon arriving at the\\nevent, took one look at her father-in-law and got very\\nconcerned.\\n“I don’t like the way you look,” she said.\\nHer father-in-law , who was feeling perfectly ﬁne, jokingly\\nreplied, “ Well, I don’t like your looks, either .”\\n“No,” she insisted. “ You need to go to the hospital now .”\\nA few hours later , the man was undergoing lifesaving\\nsurgery after an examination had revealed that he had a\\nblockage to a major artery and was at immediate risk of a\\nheart attack. W ithout his daughter-in-law’s intuition, he\\ncould have died.\\nWhat did the paramedic see? How did she predict his\\nimpending heart attack?\\nWhen major arteries are obstructed, the body focuses on\\nsending blood to critical organs and away from peripheral\\nlocations near the surface of the skin. The result is a\\nchange in the pattern of distribution of blood in the face.\\nAfter many years of working with people with heart failure,\\nthe woman had unknowingly developed the ability to\\nrecognize this pattern on sight. She couldn’t explain what it\\nwas that she noticed in her father-in-law’s face, but she\\nknew something was wrong.\\nSimilar stories exist in other ﬁelds. F or example, military\\nanalysts can identify which blip on a radar screen is an\\nenemy missile and which one is a plane from their own ﬂeet\\neven though they are traveling at the same speed, ﬂying at\\nthe same altitude, and look identical on radar in nearly\\nevery respect. During the Gulf W ar, Lieutenant Commander\\nMichael Riley saved an entire battleship when he ordered a\\nmissile shot down—despite the fact that it looked exactly\\nlike the battleship’s own planes on radar . He made the\\nright call, but even his superior oﬀicers couldn’t explain\\nhow he did it.\\nMuseum curators have been known to discern the\\ndiﬀerence between an authentic piece of art and an\\nexpertly produced counterfeit even though they can’t tell\\nyou precisely which details tipped them oﬀ . Experienced\\nradiologists can look at a brain scan and predict the area\\nwhere a stroke will develop before any obvious signs are\\nvisible to the untrained eye. I’ve even heard of hairdressers\\nnoticing whether a client is pregnant based only on the feel\\nof her hair .\\nThe human brain is a prediction machine. It is\\ncontinuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the\\ninformation it comes across. Whenever you experience\\nsomething repeatedly—like a paramedic seeing the face of\\na heart attack patient or a military analyst seeing a missile\\non a radar screen—your brain begins noticing what is\\nimportant, sorting through the details and highlighting the\\nrelevant cues, and cataloging that information for future\\nuse.\\nWith enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that\\npredict certain outcomes without consciously thinking\\nabout it. Automatically , your brain encodes the lessons\\nlearned through experience. W e can’t always explain what\\nit is we are learning, but learning is happening all along the\\nway, and your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given\\nsituation is the foundation for every habit you have.\\nWe underestimate how much our brains and bodies can\\ndo without thinking. Y ou do not tell your hair to grow , your\\nheart to pump, your lungs to breathe, or your stomach to\\ndigest. And yet your body handles all this and more on\\nautopilot. Y ou are much more than your conscious self .\\nConsider hunger . How do you know when you’re hungry?\\nYou don’t necessarily have to see a cookie on the counter to\\nrealize that it is time to eat. Appetite and hunger are\\ngoverned nonconsciously . Your body has a variety of\\nfeedback loops that gradually alert you when it is time to\\neat again and that track what is going on around you and\\nwithin you. Cravings can arise thanks to hormones and\\nchemicals circulating through your body . Suddenly , you’re\\nhungry even though you’re not quite sure what tipped you\\noﬀ.\\nThis is one of the most surprising insights about our\\nhabits: you don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to\\nbegin. Y ou can notice an opportunity and take action\\nwithout dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what\\nmakes habits useful.\\nIt’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form,\\nyour actions come under the direction of your automatic\\nand nonconscious mind. Y ou fall into old patterns before\\nyou realize what’s happening. Unless someone points it out,\\nyou may not notice that you cover your mouth with your\\nhand whenever you laugh, that you apologize before asking\\na question, or that you have a habit of ﬁnishing other\\npeople’s sentences. And the more you repeat these\\npatterns, the less likely you become to question what\\nyou’re doing and why you’re doing it.\\nI once heard of a retail clerk who was instructed to cut\\nup empty gift cards after customers had used up the\\nbalance on the card. One day , the clerk cashed out a few\\ncustomers in a row who purchased with gift cards. When\\nthe next person walked up, the clerk swiped the customer’s\\nactual credit card, picked up the scissors, and then cut it in\\nhalf—entirely on autopilot—before looking up at the\\nstunned customer and realizing what had just happened.\\nAnother woman I came across in my research was a\\nformer preschool teacher who had switched to a corporate\\njob. Even though she was now working with adults, her old\\nhabits would kick in and she kept asking coworkers if they\\nhad washed their hands after going to the bathroom. I also\\nfound the story of a man who had spent years working as a\\nlifeguard and would occasionally yell “ Walk!” whenever he\\nsaw a child running.\\nOver time, the cues that spark our habits become so\\ncommon that they are essentially invisible: the treats on the\\nkitchen counter , the remote control next to the couch, the\\nphone in our pocket. Our responses to these cues are so\\ndeeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes\\nfrom nowhere. F or this reason, we must begin the process\\nof behavior change with awareness.\\nBefore we can eﬀectively build new habits, we need to\\nget a handle on our current ones. This can be more\\nchallenging than it sounds because once a habit is ﬁrmly\\nrooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and automatic.\\nIf a habit remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it.\\nAs the psychologist Carl Jung said, “ Until you make the\\nunconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will\\ncall it fate.”\\nTHE HABITS SCORECARD\\nThe Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best\\nin the world. If you ever ﬁnd yourself riding a train in\\nTokyo, you’ll notice that the conductors have a peculiar\\nhabit.\\nAs each operator runs the train, they proceed through a\\nritual of pointing at diﬀerent objects and calling out\\ncommands. When the train approaches a signal, the\\noperator will point at it and say , “Signal is green.” As the\\ntrain pulls into and out of each station, the operator will\\npoint at the speedometer and call out the exact speed.\\nWhen it’s time to leave, the operator will point at the\\ntimetable and state the time. Out on the platform, other\\nemployees are performing similar actions. Before each\\ntrain departs, staﬀ members will point along the edge of\\nthe platform and declare, “ All clear!” Every detail is\\nidentiﬁed, pointed at, and named aloud. *\\nThis process, known as Pointing-and-Calling , is a safety\\nsystem designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly , but it\\nworks incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors\\nby up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The\\nMTA subway system in New Y ork City adopted a modiﬁed\\nversion that is “point-only ,” and “within two years of\\nimplementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways\\nfell 57 percent.”\\nPointing-and-Calling is so eﬀective because it raises the\\nlevel of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more\\nconscious level. Because the train operators must use their\\neyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice\\nproblems before something goes wrong.\\nMy wife does something similar . Whenever we are\\npreparing to walk out the door for a trip, she verbally calls\\nout the most essential items in her packing list. “I’ve got\\nmy keys. I’ve got my wallet. I’ve got my glasses. I’ve got my\\nhusband.”\\nThe more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely\\nwe are to consciously think about it. And when we’ve done\\nsomething a thousand times before, we begin to overlook\\nthings. W e assume that the next time will be just like the\\nlast. W e’re so used to doing what we’ve always done that\\nwe don’t stop to question whether it’s the right thing to do\\nat all. Many of our failures in performance are largely\\nattributable to a lack of self -awareness.\\nOne of our greatest challenges in changing habits is\\nmaintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. This\\nhelps explain why the consequences of bad habits can\\nsneak up on us. W e need a “point-and-call” system for our\\npersonal lives. That’s the origin of the Habits Scorecard,\\nwhich is a simple exercise you can use to become more\\naware of your behavior . To create your own, make a list of\\nyour daily habits.\\nHere’s a sample of where your list might start:\\nWake up\\nTurn oﬀ alarm\\nCheck my phone\\nGo to the bathroom\\nWeigh myself\\nTake a shower\\nBrush my teeth\\nFloss my teeth\\nPut on deodorant\\nHang up towel to dry\\nGet dressed\\nMake a cup of tea\\n. . . and so on.\\nOnce you have a full list, look at each behavior , and ask\\nyourself , “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral\\nhabit?” If it is a good habit, write “+” next to it. If it is a\\nbad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.\\nFor example, the list above might look like this:\\nWake up =\\nTurn oﬀ alarm =\\nCheck my phone –\\nGo to the bathroom =\\nWeigh myself +\\nTake a shower +\\nBrush my teeth +\\nFloss my teeth +\\nPut on deodorant +\\nHang up towel to dry =\\nGet dressed =\\nMake a cup of tea +\\nThe marks you give to a particular habit will depend on\\nyour situation and your goals. F or someone who is trying to\\nlose weight, eating a bagel with peanut butter every\\nmorning might be a bad habit. F or someone who is trying\\nto bulk up and add muscle, the same behavior might be a\\ngood habit. It all depends on what you’re working toward. *\\nScoring your habits can be a bit more complex for\\nanother reason as well. The labels “good habit” and “bad\\nhabit” are slightly inaccurate. There are no good habits or\\nbad habits. There are only eﬀective habits. That is, eﬀective\\nat solving problems. All habits serve you in some way—\\neven the bad ones—which is why you repeat them. F or this\\nexercise, categorize your habits by how they will beneﬁt\\nyou in the long run. Generally speaking, good habits will\\nhave net positive outcomes. Bad habits have net negative\\noutcomes. Smoking a cigarette may reduce stress right\\nnow (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy\\nlong-term behavior .\\nIf you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a\\nparticular habit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this\\nbehavior help me become the type of person I wish to be?\\nDoes this habit cast a vote for or against my desired\\nidentity?” Habits that reinforce your desired identity are\\nusually good. Habits that conﬂict with your desired identity\\nare usually bad.\\nAs you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to\\nchange anything at ﬁrst. The goal is to simply notice what\\nis actually going on. Observe your thoughts and actions\\nwithout judgment or internal criticism. Don’t blame\\nyourself for your faults. Don’t praise yourself for your\\nsuccesses.\\nIf you eat a chocolate bar every morning, acknowledge it,\\nalmost as if you were watching someone else. Oh, how\\ninteresting that they would do such a thing.  If you binge-\\neat, simply notice that you are eating more calories than\\nyou should. If you waste time online, notice that you are\\nspending your life in a way that you do not want to .\\nThe ﬁrst step to changing bad habits is to be on the\\nlookout for them. If you feel like you need extra help, then\\nyou can try P ointing-and-Calling in your own life. Say out\\nloud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the\\noutcome will be. If you want to cut back on your junk food\\nhabit but notice yourself grabbing another cookie, say out\\nloud, “I’m about to eat this cookie, but I don’t need it.\\nEating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health.”\\nHearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the\\nconsequences seem more real. It adds weight to the action\\nrather than letting yourself mindlessly slip into an old\\nroutine. This approach is useful even if you’re simply trying\\nto remember a task on your to-do list. Just saying out loud,\\n“Tomorrow , I need to go to the post oﬀice after lunch,”\\nincreases the odds that you’ll actually do it. Y ou’re getting\\nyourself to acknowledge the need for action—and that can\\nmake all the diﬀerence.\\nThe process of behavior change always starts with\\nawareness. Strategies like P ointing-and-Calling and the\\nHabits Scorecard are focused on getting you to recognize\\nyour habits and acknowledge the cues that trigger them,\\nwhich makes it possible to respond in a way that beneﬁts\\nyou.\\nChapter Summary\\nWith enough practice, your brain will pick up on the\\ncues that predict certain outcomes without consciously\\nthinking about it.\\nOnce our habits become automatic, we stop paying\\nattention to what we are doing.\\nThe process of behavior change always starts with\\nawareness. Y ou need to be aware of your habits before\\nyou can change them.\\nPointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness\\nfrom a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by\\nverbalizing your actions.\\nThe Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use\\nto become more aware of your behavior .\\nI\\n5\\nThe Best W ay to Start a New Habit\\nN 2001 , RESEARCHERS in Great Britain began working with\\n248 people to build better exercise habits over the course\\nof two weeks. The subjects were divided into three groups.\\nThe ﬁrst group was the control group. They were simply\\nasked to track how often they exercised.\\nThe second group was the “motivation” group. They\\nwere asked not only to track their workouts but also to\\nread some material on the beneﬁts of exercise. The\\nresearchers also explained to the group how exercise could\\nreduce the risk of coronary heart disease and improve\\nheart health.\\nFinally , there was the third group. These subjects\\nreceived the same presentation as the second group, which\\nensured that they had equal levels of motivation. However ,\\nthey were also asked to formulate a plan for when and\\nwhere they would exercise over the following week.\\nSpeciﬁcally , each member of the third group completed the\\nfollowing sentence: “During the next week, I will partake in\\nat least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DA Y] at [TIME]\\nin [PLACE].”\\nIn the ﬁrst and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of\\npeople exercised at least once per week. (Interestingly , the\\nmotivational presentation given to the second group\\nseemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior .) But 91\\npercent of the third group exercised at least once per week\\n—more than double the normal rate.\\nThe sentence they ﬁlled out is what researchers refer to\\nas an implementation intention , which is a plan you make\\nbeforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you\\nintend  to implement  a particular habit.\\nThe cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of\\nforms—the feel of your phone buzzing in your pocket, the\\nsmell of chocolate chip cookies, the sound of ambulance\\nsirens—but the two most common cues are time and\\nlocation. Implementation intentions leverage both of these\\ncues.\\nBroadly speaking, the format for creating an\\nimplementation intention is:\\n“When situation X arises, I will perform response\\nY.”\\nHundreds of studies have shown that implementation\\nintentions are eﬀective for sticking to our goals, whether\\nit’s writing down the exact time and date of when you will\\nget a ﬂu shot or recording the time of your colonoscopy\\nappointment. They increase the odds that people will stick\\nwith habits like recycling, studying, going to sleep early ,\\nand stopping smoking.\\nResearchers have even found that voter turnout\\nincreases when people are forced to create implementation\\nintentions by answering questions like: “ What route are\\nyou taking to the polling station? A t what time are you\\nplanning to go? What bus will get you there?” Other\\nsuccessful government programs have prompted citizens to\\nmake a clear plan to send taxes in on time or provided\\ndirections on when and where to pay late traﬀic bills.\\nThe punch line is clear: people who make a speciﬁc plan\\nfor when and where they will perform a new habit are more\\nlikely to follow through. T oo many people try to change\\ntheir habits without these basic details ﬁgured out. W e tell\\nourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier” or “I’m going to\\nwrite more,” but we never say when and where these\\nhabits are going to happen. W e leave it up to chance and\\nhope that we will “just remember to do it” or feel motivated\\nat the right time. An implementation intention sweeps away\\nfoggy notions like “I want to work out more” or “I want to\\nbe more productive” or “I should vote” and transforms\\nthem into a concrete plan of action.\\nMany people think they lack motivation when what they\\nreally lack is clarity . It is not always obvious when and\\nwhere to take action. Some people spend their entire lives\\nwaiting for the time to be right to make an improvement.\\nOnce an implementation intention has been set, you\\ndon’t have to wait for inspiration to strike. Do I write a\\nchapter today or not? Do I meditate this morning or at\\nlunch?  When the moment of action occurs, there is no need\\nto make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.\\nThe simple way to apply this strategy to your habits\\nis to ﬁll out this sentence:\\nI will [BEHA VIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCA TION].\\nMeditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in\\nmy kitchen.\\nStudying. I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6\\np.m. in my bedroom.\\nExercise. I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my\\nlocal gym.\\nMarriage. I will make my partner a cup of tea at 8 a.m.\\nin the kitchen.\\nIf you aren’t sure when to start your habit, try the ﬁrst\\nday of the week, month, or year . People are more likely to\\ntake action at those times because hope is usually higher . If\\nwe have hope, we have a reason to take action. A fresh\\nstart feels motivating.\\nThere is another beneﬁt to implementation intentions.\\nBeing speciﬁc about what you want and how you will\\nachieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress,\\ndistract your attention, and pull you oﬀ course. W e often\\nsay yes to little requests because we are not clear enough\\nabout what we need to be doing instead. When your\\ndreams are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions\\nall day long and never get around to the speciﬁc things you\\nneed to do to succeed.\\nGive your habits a time and a space to live in the world.\\nThe goal is to make the time and location so obvious that,\\nwith enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right\\nthing at the right time, even if you can’t say why . As the\\nwriter Jason Zweig noted, “Obviously you’re never going to\\njust work out without conscious thought. But like a dog\\nsalivating at a bell, maybe you start to get antsy around the\\ntime of day you normally work out.”\\nThere are many ways to use implementation intentions in\\nyour life and work. My favorite approach is one I learned\\nfrom Stanford professor BJ F ogg and it is a strategy I refer\\nto as habit stacking .\\nHABIT ST ACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO O VERHA UL YOUR\\nHABITS\\nThe French philosopher Denis Diderot lived nearly his\\nentire life in poverty , but that all changed one day in 1765.\\nDiderot’s daughter was about to be married and he could\\nnot aﬀord to pay for the wedding. Despite his lack of\\nwealth, Diderot was well known for his role as the co-\\nfounder and writer of Encyclopédie , one of the most\\ncomprehensive encyclopedias of the time. When Catherine\\nthe Great, the Empress of Russia, heard of Diderot’s\\nﬁnancial troubles, her heart went out to him. She was a\\nbook lover and greatly enjoyed his encyclopedia. She\\noﬀered to buy Diderot’s personal library for £1,000—more\\nthan $150,000 today .* Suddenly , Diderot had money to\\nspare. W ith his new wealth, he not only paid for the\\nwedding but also acquired a scarlet robe for himself .\\nDiderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact,\\nthat he immediately noticed how out of place it seemed\\nwhen surrounded by his more common possessions. He\\nwrote that there was “ no more coordination, no more unity ,\\nno more beauty” between his elegant robe and the rest of\\nhis stuﬀ .\\nDiderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He\\nreplaced his rug with one from Damascus. He decorated his\\nhome with expensive sculptures. He bought a mirror to\\nplace above the mantel, and a better kitchen table. He\\ntossed aside his old straw chair for a leather one. Like\\nfalling dominoes, one purchase led to the next.\\nDiderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the\\ntendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a\\nname: the Diderot Eﬀect. The Diderot Eﬀect states that\\nobtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of\\nconsumption that leads to additional purchases.\\nYou can spot this pattern everywhere. Y ou buy a dress\\nand have to get new shoes and earrings to match. Y ou buy\\na couch and suddenly question the layout of your entire\\nliving room. Y ou buy a toy for your child and soon ﬁnd\\nyourself purchasing all of the accessories that go with it.\\nIt’s a chain reaction of purchases.\\nMany human behaviors follow this cycle. Y ou often\\ndecide what to do next based on what you have just\\nﬁnished doing. Going to the bathroom leads to washing and\\ndrying your hands, which reminds you that you need to put\\nthe dirty towels in the laundry , so you add laundry\\ndetergent to the shopping list, and so on. No behavior\\nhappens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that\\ntriggers the next behavior .\\nWhy is this important?\\nWhen it comes to building new habits, you can use the\\nconnectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the\\nbest ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit\\nyou already do each day and then stack your new behavior\\non top. This is called habit stacking .\\nHabit stacking is a special form of an implementation\\nintention. R ather than pairing your new habit with a\\nparticular time and location, you pair it with a current\\nhabit. This method, which was created by BJ F ogg as part\\nof his Tiny Habits program, can be used to design an\\nobvious cue for nearly any habit. *\\nThe habit stacking formula is:\\n“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”\\nFor example:\\nMeditation. A fter I pour my cup of coﬀee each\\nmorning, I will meditate for one minute.\\nExercise. A fter I take oﬀ my work shoes, I will\\nimmediately change into my workout clothes.\\nGratitude. A fter I sit down to dinner , I will say one\\nthing I’m grateful for that happened today .\\nMarriage. A fter I get into bed at night, I will give my\\npartner a kiss.\\nSafety . After I put on my running shoes, I will text a\\nfriend or family member where I am running and how\\nlong it will take.\\nThe key is to tie your desired behavior into something\\nyou already do each day . Once you have mastered this basic\\nstructure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining\\nsmall habits together . This allows you to take advantage of\\nthe natural momentum that comes from one behavior\\nleading into the next—a positive version of the Diderot\\nEﬀect.\\nHABIT ST ACKING\\nFIGURE 7:  Habit stacking incr eases the lik elihood that you’ll stick\\nwith a habit by stacking your new behavior on top of an old one.\\nThis pr ocess can be r epeated to chain numer ous habits\\ntogether, each one acting as the cue for the ne xt.\\nYour morning routine habit stack might look like this:\\n1. After I pour my morning cup of coﬀee, I will meditate\\nfor sixty seconds.\\n2. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do\\nlist for the day .\\n3. After I write my to-do list for the day , I will\\nimmediately begin my ﬁrst task.\\nOr, consider this habit stack in the evening:\\n1. After I ﬁnish eating dinner , I will put my plate directly\\ninto the dishwasher .\\n2. After I put my dishes away , I will immediately wipe\\ndown the counter .\\n3. After I wipe down the counter , I will set out my coﬀee\\nmug for tomorrow morning.\\nYou can also insert new behaviors into the middle of your\\ncurrent routines. F or example, you may already have a\\nmorning routine that looks like this: W ake up > Make my\\nbed > T ake a shower . Let’s say you want to develop the\\nhabit of reading more each night. Y ou can expand your\\nhabit stack and try something like: W ake up > Make my\\nbed > Place a book on my pillow  > Take a shower . Now ,\\nwhen you climb into bed each night, a book will be sitting\\nthere waiting for you to enjoy .\\nOverall, habit stacking allows you to create a set of\\nsimple rules that guide your future behavior . It’s like you\\nalways have a game plan for which action should come\\nnext. Once you get comfortable with this approach, you can\\ndevelop general habit stacks to guide you whenever the\\nsituation is appropriate:\\nExercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them\\ninstead of using the elevator .\\nSocial skills. When I walk into a party , I will introduce\\nmyself to someone I don’t know yet.\\nFinances. When I want to buy something over $100, I\\nwill wait twenty-four hours before purchasing.\\nHealthy eating. When I serve myself a meal, I will\\nalways put veggies on my plate ﬁrst.\\nMinimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give\\nsomething away . (“One in, one out.”)\\nMood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep\\nbreath and smile before answering.\\nForgetfulness. When I leave a public place, I will check\\nthe table and chairs to make sure I don’t leave\\nanything behind.\\nNo matter how you use this strategy , the secret to\\ncreating a successful habit stack is selecting the right cue\\nto kick things oﬀ . Unlike an implementation intention,\\nwhich speciﬁcally states the time and location for a given\\nbehavior , habit stacking implicitly has the time and location\\nbuilt into it. When and where you choose to insert a habit\\ninto your daily routine can make a big diﬀerence. If you’re\\ntrying to add meditation into your morning routine but\\nmornings are chaotic and your kids keep running into the\\nroom, then that may be the wrong place and time. Consider\\nwhen you are most likely to be successful. Don’t ask\\nyourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied\\nwith something else.\\nYour cue should also have the same frequency as your\\ndesired habit. If you want to do a habit every day , but you\\nstack it on top of a habit that only happens on Mondays,\\nthat’s not a good choice.\\nOne way to ﬁnd the right trigger for your habit stack is\\nby brainstorming a list of your current habits. Y ou can use\\nyour Habits Scorecard from the last chapter as a starting\\npoint. Alternatively , you can create a list with two columns.\\nIn the ﬁrst column, write down the habits you do each day\\nwithout fail. *\\nFor example:\\nGet out of bed.\\nTake a shower .\\nBrush your teeth.\\nGet dressed.\\nBrew a cup of coﬀee.\\nEat breakfast.\\nTake the kids to school.\\nStart the work day .\\nEat lunch.\\nEnd the work day .\\nChange out of work clothes.\\nSit down for dinner .\\nTurn oﬀ the lights.\\nGet into bed.\\nYour list can be much longer , but you get the idea. In the\\nsecond column, write down all of the things that happen to\\nyou each day without fail. F or example:\\nThe sun rises.\\nYou get a text message.\\nThe song you are listening to ends.\\nThe sun sets.\\nArmed with these two lists, you can begin searching for\\nthe best place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle.\\nHabit stacking works best when the cue is highly speciﬁc\\nand immediately actionable. Many people select cues that\\nare too vague. I made this mistake myself . When I wanted\\nto start a push-up habit, my habit stack was “ When I take a\\nbreak for lunch, I will do ten push-ups.” A t ﬁrst glance, this\\nsounded reasonable. But soon, I realized the trigger was\\nunclear . Would I do my push-ups before I ate lunch? A fter I\\nate lunch? Where would I do them? A fter a few inconsistent\\ndays, I changed my habit stack to: “ When I close my laptop\\nfor lunch, I will do ten push-ups next to my desk.”\\nAmbiguity gone.\\nHabits like “read more” or “eat better” are worthy\\ncauses, but these goals do not provide instruction on how\\nand when to act. Be speciﬁc and clear: A fter I close the\\ndoor. After I brush my teeth. A fter I sit down at the table.\\nThe speciﬁcity is important. The more tightly bound your\\nnew habit is to a speciﬁc cue, the better the odds are that\\nyou will notice when the time comes to act.\\nThe 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious.\\nStrategies like implementation intentions and habit\\nstacking are among the most practical ways to create\\nobvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for\\nwhen and where to take action.\\nChapter Summary\\nThe 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious .\\nThe two most common cues are time and location.\\nCreating an implementation intention is a strategy you\\ncan use to pair a new habit with a speciﬁc time and\\nlocation.\\nThe implementation intention formula is: I will\\n[BEHA VIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCA TION].\\nHabit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new\\nhabit with a current habit.\\nThe habit stacking formula is: A fter [CURRENT\\nHABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].\\n6\\nMotivation Is Over rated; Envir onment Of ten Matters\\nMore\\nANNE THORNDIKE , A primary care physician at Massachusetts\\nGeneral Hospital in Boston, had a crazy idea. She believed\\nshe could improve the eating habits of thousands of\\nhospital staﬀ and visitors without changing their willpower\\nor motivation in the slightest way . In fact, she didn’t plan\\non talking to them at all.\\nThorndike and her colleagues designed a six -month study\\nto alter the “choice architecture” of the hospital cafeteria.\\nThey started by changing how drinks were arranged in the\\nroom. Originally , the refrigerators located next to the cash\\nregisters in the cafeteria were ﬁlled with only soda. The\\nresearchers added water as an option to each one.\\nAdditionally , they placed baskets of bottled water next to\\nthe food stations throughout the room. Soda was still in the\\nprimary refrigerators, but water was now available at all\\ndrink locations.\\nOver the next three months, the number of soda sales at\\nthe hospital dropped by 11.4 percent. Meanwhile, sales of\\nbottled water increased by 25.8 percent. They made similar\\nadjustments—and saw similar results—with the food in the\\ncafeteria. Nobody had said a word to anyone eating there.\\nAFTER BEFORE\\nFIGURE 8:  Here is a r epresentation of what the cafeteria look ed\\nlike befor e the envir onment design changes wer e made (lef t)\\nand af ter (right). The shaded bo xes indicate ar eas wher e bottled\\nwater was available in each instance. Because the amount of\\nwater in the envir onment was incr eased, behavior shif ted\\nnaturally and without additional motivation.\\nPeople often choose products not because of what  they\\nare, but because of where  they are. If I walk into the\\nkitchen and see a plate of cookies on the counter , I’ll pick\\nup half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn’t been\\nthinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily feel\\nhungry . If the communal table at the oﬀice is always ﬁlled\\nwith doughnuts and bagels, it’s going to be hard not to\\ngrab one every now and then. Y our habits change\\ndepending on the room you are in and the cues in front of\\nyou.\\nEnvironment is the invisible hand that shapes human\\nbehavior . Despite our unique personalities, certain\\nbehaviors tend to arise again and again under certain\\nenvironmental conditions. In church, people tend to talk in\\nwhispers. On a dark street, people act wary and guarded.\\nIn this way , the most common form of change is not\\ninternal, but external: we are changed by the world around\\nus. Every habit is context dependent.\\nIn 1936, psychologist K urt Lewin wrote a simple\\nequation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a\\nfunction of the P erson in their Environment, or B = f (P,E).\\nIt didn’t take long for Lewin’s Equation to be tested in\\nbusiness. In 1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described\\na phenomenon he called Suggestion Impulse Buying , which\\n“is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the ﬁrst\\ntime and visualizes a need for it.” In other words,\\ncustomers will occasionally buy products not because they\\nwant  them but because of how they are presented  to them.\\nFor example, items at eye level tend to be purchased\\nmore than those down near the ﬂoor . For this reason, you’ll\\nﬁnd expensive brand names featured in easy-to-reach\\nlocations on store shelves because they drive the most\\nproﬁt, while cheaper alternatives are tucked away in\\nharder-to-reach spots. The same goes for end caps, which\\nare the units at the end of aisles. End caps are\\nmoneymaking machines for retailers because they are\\nobvious locations that encounter a lot of foot traﬀic. F or\\nexample, 45 percent of Coca-Cola sales come speciﬁcally\\nfrom end-of -the-aisle racks.\\nThe more obviously available a product or service is, the\\nmore likely you are to try it. People drink Bud Light\\nbecause it is in every bar and visit Starbucks because it is\\non every corner . We like to think that we are in control. If\\nwe choose water over soda, we assume it is because we\\nwanted to do so . The truth, however , is that many of the\\nactions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful\\ndrive and choice but by the most obvious option.\\nEvery living being has its own methods for sensing and\\nunderstanding the world. Eagles have remarkable long-\\ndistance vision. Snakes can smell by “tasting the air” with\\ntheir highly sensitive tongues. Sharks can detect small\\namounts of electricity and vibrations in the water caused by\\nnearby ﬁsh. Even bacteria have chemoreceptors—tiny\\nsensory cells that allow them to detect toxic chemicals in\\ntheir environment.\\nIn humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous\\nsystem. W e perceive the world through sight, sound, smell,\\ntouch, and taste. But we also have other ways of sensing\\nstimuli. Some are conscious, but many are nonconscious.\\nFor instance, you can “notice” when the temperature drops\\nbefore a storm, or when the pain in your gut rises during a\\nstomachache, or when you fall oﬀ balance while walking on\\nrocky ground. Receptors in your body pick up on a wide\\nrange of internal stimuli, such as the amount of salt in your\\nblood or the need to drink when thirsty .\\nThe most powerful of all human sensory abilities,\\nhowever , is vision. The human body has about eleven\\nmillion sensory receptors. Approximately ten million of\\nthose are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that\\nhalf of the brain’s resources are used on vision. Given that\\nwe are more dependent on vision than on any other sense,\\nit should come as no surprise that visual cues are the\\ngreatest catalyst of our behavior . For this reason, a small\\nchange in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you\\ndo. As a result, you can imagine how important it is to live\\nand work in environments that are ﬁlled with productive\\ncues and devoid of unproductive ones.\\nThankfully , there is good news in this respect. Y ou don’t\\nhave to be the victim of your environment. Y ou can also be\\nthe architect of it.\\nHOW TO DESIGN Y OUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCES S\\nDuring the energy crisis and oil embargo of the 1970s,\\nDutch researchers began to pay close attention to the\\ncountry’s energy usage. In one suburb near Amsterdam,\\nthey found that some homeowners used 30 percent less\\nenergy than their neighbors—despite the homes being of\\nsimilar size and getting electricity for the same price.\\nIt turned out the houses in this neighborhood were\\nnearly identical except for one feature: the location of the\\nelectrical meter . Some had one in the basement. Others\\nhad the electrical meter upstairs in the main hallway . As\\nyou may guess, the homes with the meters located in the\\nmain hallway used less electricity . When their energy use\\nwas obvious and easy to track, people changed their\\nbehavior .\\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely\\nto notice cues that stand out. Unfortunately , the\\nenvironments where we live and work often make it easy\\nnot to do certain actions because there is no obvious cue to\\ntrigger the behavior . It’s easy not to practice the guitar\\nwhen it’s tucked away in the closet. It’s easy not to read a\\nbook when the bookshelf is in the corner of the guest room.\\nIt’s easy not to take your vitamins when they are out of\\nsight in the pantry . When the cues that spark a habit are\\nsubtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.\\nBy comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw\\nyour attention toward a desired habit. In the early 1990s,\\nthe cleaning staﬀ at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam\\ninstalled a small sticker that looked like a ﬂy near the\\ncenter of each urinal. Apparently , when men stepped up to\\nthe urinals, they aimed for what they thought was a bug.\\nThe stickers improved their aim and signiﬁcantly reduced\\n“spillage” around the urinals. Further analysis determined\\nthat the stickers cut bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent\\nper year .\\nI’ve experienced the power of obvious cues in my own\\nlife. I used to buy apples from the store, put them in the\\ncrisper in the bottom of the refrigerator , and forget all\\nabout them. By the time I remembered, the apples would\\nhave gone bad. I never saw them, so I never ate them.\\nEventually , I took my own advice and redesigned my\\nenvironment. I bought a large display bowl and placed it in\\nthe middle of the kitchen counter . The next time I bought\\napples, that was where they went—out in the open where I\\ncould see them. Almost like magic, I began eating a few\\napples each day simply because they were obvious rather\\nthan out of sight.\\nHere are a few ways you can redesign your environment\\nand make the cues for your preferred habits more obvious:\\nIf you want to remember to take your medication each\\nnight, put your pill bottle directly next to the faucet on\\nthe bathroom counter .\\nIf you want to practice guitar more frequently , place\\nyour guitar stand in the middle of the living room.\\nIf you want to remember to send more thank -you notes,\\nkeep a stack of stationery on your desk.\\nIf you want to drink more water , ﬁll up a few water\\nbottles each morning and place them in common\\nlocations around the house.\\nIf you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make\\nthe cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent\\nbehaviors usually have multiple cues. Consider how many\\ndiﬀerent ways a smoker could be prompted to pull out a\\ncigarette: driving in the car , seeing a friend smoke, feeling\\nstressed at work, and so on.\\nThe same strategy can be employed for good habits. By\\nsprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you\\nincrease the odds that you’ll think about your habit\\nthroughout the day . Make sure the best choice is the most\\nobvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural\\nwhen the cues for good habits are right in front of you.\\nEnvironment design is powerful not only because it\\ninﬂuences how we engage with the world but also because\\nwe rarely do it. Most people live in a world others have\\ncreated for them. But you can alter the spaces where you\\nlive and work to increase your exposure to positive cues\\nand reduce your exposure to negative ones. Environment\\ndesign allows you to take back control and become the\\narchitect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not\\nmerely the consumer of it.\\nTHE CONTEXT IS THE CUE\\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very speciﬁc, but\\nover time your habits become associated not with a single\\ntrigger but with the entire context  surrounding the\\nbehavior .\\nFor example, many people drink more in social situations\\nthan they would ever drink alone. The trigger is rarely a\\nsingle cue, but rather the whole situation: watching your\\nfriends order drinks, hearing the music at the bar , seeing\\nthe beers on tap.\\nWe mentally assign our habits to the locations in which\\nthey occur: the home, the oﬀice, the gym. Each location\\ndevelops a connection to certain habits and routines. Y ou\\nestablish a particular relationship with the objects on your\\ndesk, the items on your kitchen counter , the things in your\\nbedroom.\\nOur behavior is not deﬁned by the objects in the\\nenvironment but by our relationship to them. In fact, this is\\na useful way to think about the inﬂuence of the\\nenvironment on your behavior . Stop thinking about your\\nenvironment as ﬁlled with objects. Start thinking about it\\nas ﬁlled with relationships. Think in terms of how you\\ninteract with the spaces around you. F or one person, her\\ncouch is the place where she reads for an hour each night.\\nFor someone else, the couch is where he watches television\\nand eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Diﬀerent people\\ncan have diﬀerent memories—and thus diﬀerent habits—\\nassociated with the same place.\\nThe good news? Y ou can train yourself to link a\\nparticular habit with a particular context.\\nIn one study , scientists instructed insomniacs to get into\\nbed only when they were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep,\\nthey were told to sit in a diﬀerent room until they became\\nsleepy . Over time, subjects began to associate the context\\nof their bed with the action of sleeping, and it became\\neasier to quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed.\\nTheir brains learned that sleeping—not browsing on their\\nphones, not watching television, not staring at the clock—\\nwas the only action that happened in that room.\\nThe power of context also reveals an important strategy:\\nhabits can be easier to change in a new environment. It\\nhelps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you\\ntoward your current habits. Go to a new place—a diﬀerent\\ncoﬀee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you\\nseldom use—and create a new routine there.\\nIt is easier to associate a new habit with a new context\\nthan to build a new habit in the face of competing cues. It\\ncan be diﬀicult to go to bed early if you watch television in\\nyour bedroom each night. It can be hard to study in the\\nliving room without getting distracted if that’s where you\\nalways play video games. But when you step outside your\\nnormal environment, you leave your behavioral biases\\nbehind. You aren’t battling old environmental cues, which\\nallows new habits to form without interruption.\\nWant to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a\\nrooftop patio, or a building with expansive architecture.\\nTake a break from the space where you do your daily work,\\nwhich is also linked to your current thought patterns.\\nTrying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on\\nautopilot at your regular supermarket. Try a new grocery\\nstore. Y ou may ﬁnd it easier to avoid unhealthy food when\\nyour brain doesn’t automatically know where it is located in\\nthe store.\\nWhen you can’t manage to get to an entirely new\\nenvironment, redeﬁne or rearrange your current one.\\nCreate a separate space for work, study , exercise,\\nentertainment, and cooking. The mantra I ﬁnd useful is\\n“One space, one use.”\\nWhen I started my career as an entrepreneur , I would\\noften work from my couch or at the kitchen table. In the\\nevenings, I found it very diﬀicult to stop working. There\\nwas no clear division between the end of work time and the\\nbeginning of personal time. W as the kitchen table my oﬀice\\nor the space where I ate meals? W as the couch where I\\nrelaxed or where I sent emails? Everything happened in the\\nsame place.\\nA few years later , I could ﬁnally aﬀord to move to a home\\nwith a separate room for my oﬀice. Suddenly , work was\\nsomething that happened “in here” and personal life was\\nsomething that happened “out there.” It was easier for me\\nto turn oﬀ the professional side of my brain when there was\\na clear dividing line between work life and home life. Each\\nroom had one primary use. The kitchen was for cooking.\\nThe oﬀice was for working.\\nWhenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit\\nwith another . When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start\\nmixing habits—and the easier ones will usually win out.\\nThis is one reason why the versatility of modern technology\\nis both a strength and a weakness. Y ou can use your phone\\nfor all sorts of tasks, which makes it a powerful device. But\\nwhen you can use your phone to do nearly anything, it\\nbecomes hard to associate it with one task. Y ou want to be\\nproductive, but you’re also conditioned to browse social\\nmedia, check email, and play video games whenever you\\nopen your phone. It’s a mishmash of cues.\\nYou may be thinking, “ You don’t understand. I live in\\nNew Y ork City . My apartment is the size of a smartphone. I\\nneed each room to play multiple roles.” F air enough. If your\\nspace is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a\\nchair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. Y ou\\ncan do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer\\nwho uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for\\nreading, and his phone only for social media and texting.\\nEvery habit should have a home.\\nIf you can manage to stick with this strategy , each\\ncontext will become associated with a particular habit and\\nmode of thought. Habits thrive under predictable\\ncircumstances like these. F ocus comes automatically when\\nyou are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is easier when\\nyou are in a space designed for that purpose. Sleep comes\\nquickly when it is the only thing that happens in your\\nbedroom. If you want behaviors that are stable and\\npredictable, you need an environment that is stable and\\npredictable.\\nA stable environment where everything has a place and a\\npurpose is an environment where habits can easily form.\\nChapter Summary\\nSmall changes in context can lead to large changes in\\nbehavior over time.\\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue. W e are more likely to\\nnotice cues that stand out.\\nMake the cues of good habits obvious in your\\nenvironment.\\nGradually , your habits become associated not with a\\nsingle trigger but with the entire context surrounding\\nthe behavior . The context becomes the cue.\\nIt is easier to build new habits in a new environment\\nbecause you are not ﬁghting against old cues.\\nI\\n7\\nThe Secr et to Self -Contr ol\\nN 1971 , as the V ietnam W ar was heading into its sixteenth\\nyear, congressmen Robert Steele from Connecticut and\\nMorgan Murphy from Illinois made a discovery that\\nstunned the American public. While visiting the troops,\\nthey had learned that over 15 percent of U .S. soldiers\\nstationed there were heroin addicts. Follow-up research\\nrevealed that 35 percent of service members in V ietnam\\nhad tried heroin and as many as 20 percent were addicted\\n—the problem was even worse than they had initially\\nthought.\\nThe discovery led to a ﬂurry of activity in W ashington,\\nincluding the creation of the Special Action Oﬀice of Drug\\nAbuse Prevention under President Nixon to promote\\nprevention and rehabilitation and to track addicted service\\nmembers when they returned home.\\nLee Robins was one of the researchers in charge. In a\\nﬁnding that completely upended the accepted beliefs about\\naddiction, Robins found that when soldiers who had been\\nheroin users returned home, only 5 percent of them\\nbecame re-addicted within a year , and just 12 percent\\nrelapsed within three years. In other words, approximately\\nnine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in V ietnam\\neliminated their addiction nearly overnight.\\nThis ﬁnding contradicted the prevailing view at the time,\\nwhich considered heroin addiction to be a permanent and\\nirreversible condition. Instead, Robins revealed that\\naddictions could spontaneously dissolve if there was a\\nradical change in the environment. In V ietnam, soldiers\\nspent all day surrounded by cues triggering heroin use: it\\nwas easy to access, they were engulfed by the constant\\nstress of war , they built friendships with fellow soldiers\\nwho were also heroin users, and they were thousands of\\nmiles from home. Once a soldier returned to the United\\nStates, though, he found himself in an environment devoid\\nof those triggers. When the context changed, so did the\\nhabit.\\nCompare this situation to that of a typical drug user .\\nSomeone becomes addicted at home or with friends, goes\\nto a clinic to get clean—which is devoid of all the\\nenvironmental stimuli that prompt their habit—then\\nreturns to their old neighborhood with all of their previous\\ncues that caused them to get addicted in the ﬁrst place. It’s\\nno wonder that usually you see numbers that are the exact\\nopposite of those in the V ietnam study . Typically , 90\\npercent of heroin users become re-addicted once they\\nreturn home from rehab.\\nThe V ietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural\\nbeliefs about bad habits because it challenged the\\nconventional association of unhealthy behavior as a moral\\nweakness. If you’re overweight, a smoker , or an addict,\\nyou’ve been told your entire life that it is because you lack\\nself-control—maybe even that you’re a bad person. The idea\\nthat a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is\\ndeeply embedded in our culture.\\nRecent research, however , shows something diﬀerent.\\nWhen scientists analyze people who appear to have\\ntremendous self -control, it turns out those individuals\\naren’t all that diﬀerent from those who are struggling.\\nInstead, “ disciplined” people are better at structuring their\\nlives in a way that does not require  heroic willpower and\\nself-control. In other words, they spend less time in\\ntempting situations.\\nThe people with the best self -control are typically the\\nones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice\\nself-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. So,\\nyes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to\\nsuccess, but the way to improve these qualities is not by\\nwishing you were a more disciplined person, but by\\ncreating a more disciplined environment.\\nThis counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once\\nyou understand what happens when a habit is formed in\\nthe brain. A habit that has been encoded in the mind is\\nready to be used whenever the relevant situation arises.\\nWhen P atty Olwell, a therapist from Austin, T exas, started\\nsmoking, she would often light up while riding horses with\\na friend. Eventually , she quit smoking and avoided it for\\nyears. She had also stopped riding. Decades later , she\\nhopped on a horse again and found herself craving a\\ncigarette for the ﬁrst time in forever . The cues were still\\ninternalized; she just hadn’t been exposed to them in a long\\ntime.\\nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows\\nwhenever the environmental cues reappear . This is one\\nreason behavior change techniques can backﬁre. Shaming\\nobese people with weight-loss presentations can make\\nthem feel stressed, and as a result many people return to\\ntheir favorite coping strategy: overeating. Showing pictures\\nof blackened lungs to smokers leads to higher levels of\\nanxiety , which drives many people to reach for a cigarette.\\nIf you’re not careful about cues, you can cause the very\\nbehavior you want to stop.\\nBad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself .\\nThey foster the feelings they try to numb. Y ou feel bad, so\\nyou eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad.\\nWatching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch\\nmore television because you don’t have the energy to do\\nanything else. W orrying about your health makes you feel\\nanxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety ,\\nwhich makes your health even worse and soon you’re\\nfeeling more anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway\\ntrain of bad habits.\\nResearchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced\\nwanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving\\nto repeat a bad habit. Once you notice  something, you\\nbegin to want  it. This process is happening all the time—\\noften without us realizing it. Scientists have found that\\nshowing addicts a picture of cocaine for just thirty-three\\nmilliseconds stimulates the reward pathway in the brain\\nand sparks desire. This speed is too fast for the brain to\\nconsciously register—the addicts couldn’t even tell you\\nwhat they had seen—but they craved the drug all the same.\\nHere’s the punch line: Y ou can break a habit, but you’re\\nunlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have\\nbeen carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to\\nremove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while.\\nAnd that means that simply resisting temptation is an\\nineﬀective strategy . It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in\\na life ﬁlled with interruptions. It takes too much energy . In\\nthe short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In\\nthe long-run, we become a product of the environment that\\nwe live in. T o put it bluntly , I have never seen someone\\nconsistently stick to positive habits in a negative\\nenvironment.\\nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits oﬀ at the\\nsource. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad\\nhabit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.\\nIf you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your\\nphone in another room for a few hours.\\nIf you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough,\\nstop following social media accounts that trigger\\njealousy and envy .\\nIf you’re wasting too much time watching television,\\nmove the TV out of the bedroom.\\nIf you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit\\nreading reviews of the latest tech gear .\\nIf you’re playing too many video games, unplug the\\nconsole and put it in a closet after each use.\\nThis practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior\\nChange. R ather than make it obvious , you can make it\\ninvisible . I’m often surprised by how eﬀective simple\\nchanges like these can be. Remove a single cue and the\\nentire habit often fades away .\\nSelf-control is a short-term strategy , not a long-term one.\\nYou may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s\\nunlikely you can muster the willpower to override your\\ndesires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of\\nwillpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your\\nenergy would be better spent optimizing your environment.\\nThis is the secret to self -control. Make the cues of your\\ngood habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits\\ninvisible.\\nChapter Summary\\nThe inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is\\nmake it invisible .\\nOnce a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.\\nPeople with high self -control tend to spend less time in\\ntempting situations.

Tinbergen—who\\neventually won a Nobel Prize for his work—was\\ninvestigating herring gulls, the gray and white birds often\\nseen ﬂying along the seashores of North America.\\nAdult herring gulls have a small red dot on their beak,\\nand Tinbergen noticed that newly hatched chicks would\\npeck this spot whenever they wanted food. T o begin one\\nexperiment, he created a collection of fake cardboard\\nbeaks, just a head without a body . When the parents had\\nﬂown away , he went over to the nest and oﬀered these\\ndummy beaks to the chicks. The beaks were obvious fakes,\\nand he assumed the baby birds would reject them\\naltogether .\\nHowever , when the tiny gulls saw the red spot on the\\ncardboard beak, they pecked away just as if it were\\nattached to their own mother . They had a clear preference\\nfor those red spots—as if they had been genetically\\nprogrammed at birth. Soon Tinbergen discovered that the\\nbigger the red spot, the faster the chicks pecked.\\nEventually , he created a beak with three large red dots on\\nit. When he placed it over the nest, the baby birds went\\ncrazy with delight. They pecked at the little red patches as\\nif it was the greatest beak they had ever seen.\\nTinbergen and his colleagues discovered similar behavior\\nin other animals. F or example, the greylag goose is a\\nground-nesting bird. Occasionally , as the mother moves\\naround on the nest, one of the eggs will roll out and settle\\non the grass nearby . Whenever this happens, the goose will\\nwaddle over to the egg and use its beak and neck to pull it\\nback into the nest.\\nTinbergen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby\\nround object, such as a billiard ball or a lightbulb, back into\\nthe nest. The bigger the object, the greater their response.\\nOne goose even made a tremendous eﬀort to roll a\\nvolleyball back and sit on top. Like the baby gulls\\nautomatically pecking at red dots, the greylag goose was\\nfollowing an instinctive rule: When I see a round object\\nnearby , I must roll it back into the nest. The bigger the\\nround object, the harder I should try to get it.\\nIt’s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with\\ncertain rules for behavior , and when it comes across an\\nexaggerated version of that rule, it lights up like a\\nChristmas tree. Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues\\nas supernormal stimuli . A supernormal stimulus is a\\nheightened version of reality—like a beak with three red\\ndots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a\\nstronger response than usual.\\nHumans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions\\nof reality . Junk food, for example, drives our reward\\nsystems into a frenzy . After spending hundreds of\\nthousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the\\nwild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on\\nsalt, sugar , and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and\\nthey were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were\\nroaming the savannah. When you don’t know where your\\nnext meal is coming from, eating as much as possible is an\\nexcellent strategy for survival.\\nToday, however , we live in a calorie-rich environment.\\nFood is abundant, but your brain continues to crave it like\\nit is scarce. Placing a high value on salt, sugar , and fat is no\\nlonger advantageous to our health, but the craving persists\\nbecause the brain’s reward centers have not changed for\\napproximately ﬁfty thousand years. The modern food\\nindustry relies on stretching our P aleolithic instincts\\nbeyond their evolutionary purpose.\\nA primary goal of food science is to create products that\\nare more attractive to consumers. Nearly every food in a\\nbag, box, or jar has been enhanced in some way , if only\\nwith additional ﬂavoring. Companies spend millions of\\ndollars to discover the most satisfying level of crunch in a\\npotato chip or the perfect amount of ﬁzz in a soda. Entire\\ndepartments are dedicated to optimizing how a product\\nfeels in your mouth—a quality known as orosensation .\\nFrench fries, for example, are a potent combination—\\ngolden brown and crunchy on the outside, light and smooth\\non the inside.\\nOther processed foods enhance dynamic contrast , which\\nrefers to items with a combination of sensations, like\\ncrunchy and creamy . Imagine the gooeyness of melted\\ncheese on top of a crispy pizza crust, or the crunch of an\\nOreo cookie combined with its smooth center . With natural,\\nunprocessed foods, you tend to experience the same\\nsensations over and over— how’s that seventeenth bite of\\nkale taste?  After a few minutes, your brain loses interest\\nand you begin to feel full. But foods that are high in\\ndynamic contrast keep the experience novel and\\ninteresting, encouraging you to eat more.\\nUltimately , such strategies enable food scientists to ﬁnd\\nthe “bliss point” for each product—the precise combination\\nof salt, sugar , and fat that excites your brain and keeps you\\ncoming back for more. The result, of course, is that you\\novereat because hyperpalatable foods are more attractive\\nto the human brain. As Stephan Guyenet, a neuroscientist\\nwho specializes in eating behavior and obesity , says, “ We’ve\\ngotten too good at pushing our own buttons.”\\nThe modern food industry , and the overeating habits it\\nhas spawned, is just one example of the 2nd Law of\\nBehavior Change: Make it attractive.  The more attractive\\nan opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-\\nforming.\\nLook around. Society is ﬁlled with highly engineered\\nversions of reality that are more attractive than the world\\nour ancestors evolved in. Stores feature mannequins with\\nexaggerated hips and breasts to sell clothes. Social media\\ndelivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes than we\\ncould ever get in the oﬀice or at home. Online porn splices\\ntogether stimulating scenes at a rate that would be\\nimpossible to replicate in real life. Advertisements are\\ncreated with a combination of ideal lighting, professional\\nmakeup, and Photoshopped edits—even the model doesn’t\\nlook like the person in the ﬁnal image. These are the\\nsupernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate\\nfeatures that are naturally attractive to us, and our\\ninstincts go wild as a result, driving us into excessive\\nshopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating\\nhabits, and many others.\\nIf history serves as a guide, the opportunities of the\\nfuture will be more attractive than those of today . The\\ntrend is for rewards to become more concentrated and\\nstimuli to become more enticing. Junk food is a more\\nconcentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard\\nliquor is a more concentrated form of alcohol than beer .\\nVideo games are a more concentrated form of play than\\nboard games. Compared to nature, these pleasure-packed\\nexperiences are hard to resist. W e have the brains of our\\nancestors but temptations they never had to face.\\nIf you want to increase the odds that a behavior will\\noccur , then you need to make it attractive. Throughout our\\ndiscussion of the 2nd Law , our goal is to learn how to make\\nour habits irresistible. While it is not possible to transform\\nevery habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any\\nhabit more enticing. T o do this, we must start by\\nunderstanding what a craving is and how it works.\\nWe begin by examining a biological signature that all\\nhabits share—the dopamine spike.\\nTHE DOP AMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK L OOP\\nScientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs\\nby measuring a neurotransmitter called dopamine. * The\\nimportance of dopamine became apparent in 1954 when\\nthe neuroscientists James Olds and P eter Milner ran an\\nexperiment that revealed the neurological processes\\nbehind craving and desire. By implanting electrodes in the\\nbrains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of\\ndopamine. T o the surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all\\nwill to live. They wouldn’t eat. They wouldn’t have sex.\\nThey didn’t crave anything. W ithin a few days, the animals\\ndied of thirst.\\nIn follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the\\ndopamine-releasing parts of the brain, but this time, they\\nsquirted little droplets of sugar into the mouths of the\\ndopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat faces lit up with\\npleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even though\\ndopamine was blocked, they liked  the sugar just as much as\\nbefore; they just didn’t want  it anymore. The ability to\\nexperience pleasure remained, but without dopamine,\\ndesire died. And without desire, action stopped.\\nWhen other researchers reversed this process and\\nﬂooded the reward system of the brain with dopamine,\\nanimals performed habits at breakneck speed. In one study ,\\nmice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they\\npoked their nose in a box. W ithin minutes, the mice\\ndeveloped a craving so strong they began poking their nose\\ninto the box eight hundred times per hour . (Humans are not\\nso diﬀerent: the average slot machine player will spin the\\nwheel six hundred times per hour .)\\nHabits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every\\nbehavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating\\njunk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is\\nassociated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be\\nsaid for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food,\\ndrinking water , having sex, and interacting socially .\\nFor years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about\\npleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many\\nneurological processes, including motivation, learning and\\nmemory , punishment and aversion, and voluntary\\nmovement.\\nWhen it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this:\\ndopamine is released not only when you experience\\npleasure, but also when you  anticipate  it. Gambling addicts\\nhave a dopamine spike right before  they place a bet, not\\nafter they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine\\nwhen they see the powder , not after they take it. Whenever\\nyou predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your\\nlevels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever\\ndopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.\\nIt is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulﬁllment of it\\n—that gets us to take action.\\nInterestingly , the reward system that is activated in the\\nbrain when you receive  a reward is the same system that is\\nactivated when you anticipate  a reward. This is one reason\\nthe anticipation of an experience can often feel better than\\nthe attainment of it. As a child, thinking about Christmas\\nmorning can be better than opening the gifts. As an adult,\\ndaydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more\\nenjoyable than actually being on vacation. Scientists refer\\nto this as the diﬀerence between “wanting” and “liking.”\\nTHE DOP AMINE SPIKE\\nFIGURE 9:  Befor e a habit is lear ned (A), dopamine is r eleased\\nwhen the r ewar d is e xperienced for the ﬁrst time. The ne xt time\\naround (B), dopamine rises befor e taking action, immediately\\nafter a cue is r ecognized. This spik e leads to a feeling of desir e\\nand a craving to tak e action whenever the cue is spotted. Once\\na habit is lear ned, dopamine will not rise when a r ewar d is\\nexperienced because you alr eady e xpect the r ewar d. However, if\\nyou see a cue and e xpect a r ewar d, but do not get one, then\\ndopamine will dr op in disappointment (C). The sensitivity of the\\ndopamine r esponse can clearly be seen when a r ewar d is\\nprovided late (D). F irst, the cue is identiﬁed and dopamine rises\\nas a craving builds. Ne xt, a r esponse is tak en but the r ewar d\\ndoes not come as quickly as e xpected and dopamine begins to\\ndrop. F inally, when the r ewar d comes a little later than you had\\nhoped, dopamine spik es again. It is as if the brain is saying,\\n“See! I knew I was right. Don’t for get to r epeat this action ne xt\\ntime.”\\nYour brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for\\nwanting  rewards than for liking  them. The wanting centers\\nin the brain are large: the brain stem, the nucleus\\naccumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal\\nstriatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal\\ncortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are\\nmuch smaller . They are often referred to as “hedonic hot\\nspots” and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the\\nbrain. F or instance, researchers have found that 100\\npercent of the nucleus accumbens is activated during\\nwanting. Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is\\nactivated during liking.\\nThe fact that the brain allocates so much precious space\\nto the regions responsible for craving and desire provides\\nfurther evidence of the crucial role these processes play .\\nDesire is the engine that drives behavior . Every action is\\ntaken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the\\ncraving that leads to the response.\\nThese insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of\\nBehavior Change. W e need to make our habits attractive\\nbecause it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that\\nmotivates us to act in the ﬁrst place. This is where a\\nstrategy known as temptation bundling comes into play .\\nHOW TO USE TEMPT ATION BUNDLING TO MAKE Y OUR\\nHABITS MORE A TTRACTIVE\\nRonan Byrne, an electrical engineering student in Dublin,\\nIreland, enjoyed watching Netﬂix, but he also knew that he\\nshould exercise more often than he did. Putting his\\nengineering skills to use, Byrne hacked his stationary bike\\nand connected it to his laptop and television. Then he wrote\\na computer program that would allow Netﬂix to run only if\\nhe was cycling at a certain speed. If he slowed down for too\\nlong, whatever show he was watching would pause until he\\nstarted pedaling again. He was, in the words of one fan,\\n“eliminating obesity one Netﬂix binge at a time.”\\nHe was also employing temptation bundling to make his\\nexercise habit more attractive. T emptation bundling works\\nby linking an action you want to do with an action you need\\nto do . In Byrne’s case, he bundled watching Netﬂix (the\\nthing he wanted to do) with riding his stationary bike (the\\nthing he needed to do).\\nBusinesses are masters at temptation bundling. F or\\ninstance, when the American Broadcasting Company , more\\ncommonly known as AB C, launched its Thursday-night\\ntelevision lineup for the 2014–2015 season, they promoted\\ntemptation bundling on a massive scale.\\nEvery Thursday , the company would air three shows\\ncreated by screenwriter Shonda Rhimes— Grey’s Anatomy ,\\nScandal , and How to Get A way with Murder . They branded\\nit as “TGIT on AB C” (TGIT stands for Thank God It’s\\nThursday). In addition to promoting the shows, AB C\\nencouraged viewers to make popcorn, drink red wine, and\\nenjoy the evening.\\nAndrew K ubitz, head of scheduling for AB C, described\\nthe idea behind the campaign: “ We see Thursday night as a\\nviewership opportunity , with either couples or women by\\nthemselves who want to sit down and escape and have fun\\nand drink their red wine and have some popcorn.” The\\nbrilliance of this strategy is that AB C was associating the\\nthing they needed  viewers to do (watch their shows) with\\nactivities their viewers already  wanted  to do (relax, drink\\nwine, and eat popcorn).\\nOver time, people began to connect watching AB C with\\nfeeling relaxed and entertained. If you drink red wine and\\neat popcorn at 8 p.m. every Thursday , then eventually “8\\np.m. on Thursday” means  relaxation and entertainment.\\nThe reward gets associated with the cue, and the habit of\\nturning on the television becomes more attractive.\\nYou’re more likely to ﬁnd a behavior attractive if you get\\nto do one of your favorite things at the same time. P erhaps\\nyou want to hear about the latest celebrity gossip, but you\\nneed to get in shape. Using temptation bundling, you could\\nonly read the tabloids and watch reality shows at the gym.\\nMaybe you want to get a pedicure, but you need to clean\\nout your email inbox. Solution: only get a pedicure while\\nprocessing overdue work emails.\\nTemptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology\\ntheory known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the\\nwork of professor David Premack, the principle states that\\n“more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable\\nbehaviors.” In other words, even if you don’t really want to\\nprocess overdue work emails, you’ll become conditioned to\\ndo it if it means you get to do something you really want to\\ndo along the way .\\nYou can even combine temptation bundling with the\\nhabit stacking strategy we discussed in Chapter 5 to create\\na set of rules to guide your behavior .\\nThe habit stacking + temptation bundling formula\\nis:\\n1. After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].\\n2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I W ANT].\\nIf you want to read the news, but you need to express\\nmore gratitude:\\n1. After I get my morning coﬀee, I will say one thing I’m\\ngrateful for that happened yesterday (need).\\n2. After I say one thing I’m grateful for , I will read the\\nnews (want).\\nIf you want to watch sports, but you need to make sales\\ncalls:\\n1. After I get back from my lunch break, I will call three\\npotential clients (need).\\n2. After I call three potential clients, I will check ESPN\\n(want).\\nIf you want to check F acebook, but you need to exercise\\nmore:\\n1. After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).\\n2. After I do ten burpees, I will check F acebook (want).\\nThe hope is that eventually you’ll look forward to calling\\nthree clients or doing ten burpees because it means you get\\nto read the latest sports news or check F acebook. Doing the\\nthing you need to do means you get to do the thing you\\nwant to do .\\nWe began this chapter by discussing supernormal\\nstimuli, which are heightened versions of reality that\\nincrease our desire to take action. T emptation bundling is\\none way to create a heightened version of any habit by\\nconnecting it with something you already want.\\nEngineering a truly irresistible habit is a hard task, but this\\nsimple strategy can be employed to make nearly any habit\\nmore attractive than it would be otherwise.\\nChapter Summary\\nThe 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive.\\nThe more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it\\nis to become habit-forming.\\nHabits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When\\ndopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.\\nIt is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulﬁllment of\\nit—that gets us to take action. The greater the\\nanticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.\\nTemptation bundling is one way to make your habits\\nmore attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you\\nwant  to do with an action you need  to do.\\nI\\n9\\nThe R ole of F amily and F riends in Shaping Y our Habits\\nN 1965, a Hungarian man named Laszlo P olgar wrote a\\nseries of strange letters to a woman named Klara.\\nLaszlo was a ﬁrm believer in hard work. In fact, it was all\\nhe believed in: he completely rejected the idea of innate\\ntalent. He claimed that with deliberate practice and the\\ndevelopment of good habits, a child could become a genius\\nin any ﬁeld. His mantra was “ A genius is not born, but is\\neducated and trained.”\\nLaszlo believed in this idea so strongly that he wanted to\\ntest it with his own children—and he was writing to Klara\\nbecause he “needed a wife willing to jump on board.” Klara\\nwas a teacher and, although she may not have been as\\nadamant as Laszlo, she also believed that with proper\\ninstruction, anyone could advance their skills.\\nLaszlo decided chess would be a suitable ﬁeld for the\\nexperiment, and he laid out a plan to raise his children to\\nbecome chess prodigies. The kids would be home-schooled,\\na rarity in Hungary at the time. The house would be ﬁlled\\nwith chess books and pictures of famous chess players. The\\nchildren would play against each other constantly and\\ncompete in the best tournaments they could ﬁnd. The\\nfamily would keep a meticulous ﬁle system of the\\ntournament history of every competitor the children faced.\\nTheir lives would be dedicated to chess.\\nLaszlo successfully courted Klara, and within a few\\nyears, the P olgars were parents to three young girls:\\nSusan, Soﬁa, and Judit.\\nSusan, the oldest, began playing chess when she was\\nfour years old. W ithin six months, she was defeating adults.\\nSoﬁa, the middle child, did even better . By fourteen, she\\nwas a world champion, and a few years later , she became a\\ngrandmaster .\\nJudit, the youngest, was the best of all. By age ﬁve, she\\ncould beat her father . At twelve, she was the youngest\\nplayer ever listed among the top one hundred chess players\\nin the world. A t ﬁfteen years and four months old, she\\nbecame the youngest grandmaster of all time—younger\\nthan Bobby Fischer , the previous record holder . For twenty-\\nseven years, she was the number-one-ranked female chess\\nplayer in the world.\\nThe childhood of the P olgar sisters was atypical, to say\\nthe least. And yet, if you ask them about it, they claim their\\nlifestyle was attractive, even enjoyable. In interviews, the\\nsisters talk about their childhood as entertaining rather\\nthan grueling. They loved playing chess. They couldn’t get\\nenough of it. Once, Laszlo reportedly found Soﬁa playing\\nchess in the bathroom in the middle of the night.\\nEncouraging her to go back to sleep, he said, “Soﬁa, leave\\nthe pieces alone!” T o which she replied, “Daddy , they won’t\\nleave me alone!”\\nThe P olgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized\\nchess above all else—praised them for it, rewarded them\\nfor it. In their world, an obsession with chess was normal.\\nAnd as we are about to see, whatever habits are normal in\\nyour culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll\\nﬁnd.\\nTHE SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS\\nHumans are herd animals. W e want to ﬁt in, to bond with\\nothers, and to earn the respect and approval of our peers.\\nSuch inclinations are essential to our survival. F or most of\\nour evolutionary history , our ancestors lived in tribes.\\nBecoming separated from the tribe—or worse, being cast\\nout—was a death sentence. “The lone wolf dies, but the\\npack survives.” *\\nMeanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with\\nothers enjoyed increased safety , mating opportunities, and\\naccess to resources. As Charles Darwin noted, “In the long\\nhistory of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and\\nimprovise most eﬀectively have prevailed.” As a result, one\\nof the deepest human desires is to belong. And this ancient\\npreference exerts a powerful inﬂuence on our modern\\nbehavior .\\nWe don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. W e\\nfollow the script handed down by our friends and family ,\\nour church or school, our local community and society at\\nlarge. Each of these cultures and groups comes with its\\nown set of expectations and standards—when and whether\\nto get married, how many children to have, which holidays\\nto celebrate, how much money to spend on your child’s\\nbirthday party . In many ways, these social norms are the\\ninvisible rules that guide your behavior each day . You’re\\nalways keeping them in mind, even if they are at the not\\ntop of your mind. Often, you follow the habits of your\\nculture without thinking, without questioning, and\\nsometimes without remembering. As the French\\nphilosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, “The customs and\\npractices of life in society sweep us along.”\\nMost of the time, going along with the group does not\\nfeel like a burden. Everyone wants to belong. If you grow\\nup in a family that rewards you for your chess skills,\\nplaying chess will seem like a very attractive thing to do . If\\nyou work in a job where everyone wears expensive suits,\\nthen you’ll be inclined to splurge on one as well. If all of\\nyour friends are sharing an inside joke or using a new\\nphrase, you’ll want to do it, too, so they know that you “get\\nit.” Behaviors are attractive when they help us ﬁt in.\\nWe imitate the habits of three groups in particular:\\n1. The close.\\n2. The many .\\n3. The powerful.\\nEach group oﬀers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd\\nLaw of Behavior Change and make our habits more\\nattractive.\\n1. Imitating the Close\\nProximity has a powerful eﬀect on our behavior . This is true\\nof the physical environment, as we discussed in Chapter 6,\\nbut it is also true of the social environment.\\nWe pick up habits from the people around us. W e copy\\nthe way our parents handle arguments, the way our peers\\nﬂirt with one another , the way our coworkers get results.\\nWhen your friends smoke pot, you give it a try , too. When\\nyour wife has a habit of double-checking that the door is\\nlocked before going to bed, you pick it up as well.\\nI ﬁnd that I often imitate the behavior of those around\\nme without realizing it. In conversation, I’ll automatically\\nassume the body posture of the other person. In college, I\\nbegan to talk like my roommates. When traveling to other\\ncountries, I unconsciously imitate the local accent despite\\nreminding myself to stop.\\nAs a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the\\nmore likely we are to imitate some of their habits. One\\ngroundbreaking study tracked twelve thousand people for\\nthirty-two years and found that “ a person’s chances of\\nbecoming obese increased by 57 percent if he or she had a\\nfriend who became obese.” It works the other way , too.\\nAnother study found that if one person in a relationship lost\\nweight, the other partner would also slim down about one\\nthird of the time. Our friends and family provide a sort of\\ninvisible peer pressure that pulls us in their direction.\\nOf course, peer pressure is bad only if you’re surrounded\\nby bad inﬂuences. When astronaut Mike Massimino was a\\ngraduate student at MIT , he took a small robotics class. Of\\nthe ten people in the class, four became astronauts. If your\\ngoal was to make it into space, then that room was about\\nthe best culture you could ask for . Similarly , one study\\nfound that the higher your best friend’s IQ at age eleven or\\ntwelve, the higher your IQ would be at age ﬁfteen, even\\nafter controlling for natural levels of intelligence. W e soak\\nup the qualities and practices of those around us.\\nOne of the most eﬀective things you can do to build\\nbetter habits is to join a culture where your desired\\nbehavior is the normal behavior . New habits seem\\nachievable when you see others doing them every day . If\\nyou are surrounded by ﬁt people, you’re more likely to\\nconsider working out to be a common habit. If you’re\\nsurrounded by jazz lovers, you’re more likely to believe it’s\\nreasonable to play jazz every day . Your culture sets your\\nexpectation for what is “normal.” Surround yourself with\\npeople who have the habits you want to have yourself .\\nYou’ll rise together .\\nTo make your habits even more attractive, you can take\\nthis strategy one step further .\\nJoin a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the\\nnormal behavior and (2) you already have something in\\ncommon with the group. Steve Kamb, an entrepreneur in\\nNew Y ork City , runs a company called Nerd Fitness, which\\n“helps nerds, misﬁts, and mutants lose weight, get strong,\\nand get healthy .” His clients include video game lovers,\\nmovie fanatics, and average Joes who want to get in shape.\\nMany people feel out of place the ﬁrst time they go to the\\ngym or try to change their diet, but if you are already\\nsimilar to the other members of the group in some way—\\nsay, your mutual love of Star W ars—change becomes more\\nappealing because it feels like something people like you\\nalready do .\\nNothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the\\ntribe. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one.\\nPreviously , you were on your own. Y our identity was\\nsingular . You are a reader . You are a musician. Y ou are an\\nathlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling\\ngroup, your identity becomes linked to those around you.\\nGrowth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We\\nare readers. W e are musicians. W e are cyclists.  The shared\\nidentity begins to reinforce your personal identity . This is\\nwhy remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is\\ncrucial to maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and\\ncommunity that embed a new identity and help behaviors\\nlast over the long run.\\n2. Imitating the Many\\nIn the 1950s, psychologist Solomon Asch conducted a\\nseries of experiments that are now taught to legions of\\nundergrads each year . To begin each experiment, the\\nsubject entered the room with a group of strangers.\\nUnbeknownst to them, the other participants were actors\\nplanted by the researcher and instructed to deliver scripted\\nanswers to certain questions.\\nThe group would be shown one card with a line on it and\\nthen a second card with a series of lines. Each person was\\nasked to select the line on the second card that was similar\\nin length to the line on the ﬁrst card. It was a very simple\\ntask. Here is an example of two cards used in the\\nexperiment:\\nCONFORMING TO SOCIAL NORMS\\nFIGURE 10: This is a r epresentation of two car ds used by\\nSolomon Asch in his famous social confor mity e xperiments. The\\nlength of the line on the ﬁrst car d (lef t) is obviously the same as\\nline C, but when a gr oup of actors claimed it was a diﬀer ent\\nlength the r esear ch subjects would of ten change their minds and\\ngo with the cr owd rather than believe their own eyes.\\nThe experiment always began the same. First, there\\nwould be some easy trials where everyone agreed on the\\ncorrect line. A fter a few rounds, the participants were\\nshown a test that was just as obvious as the previous ones,\\nexcept the actors in the room would select an intentionally\\nincorrect  answer . For example, they would respond “ A” to\\nthe comparison shown in Figure 10. Everyone would agree\\nthat the lines were the same even though they were clearly\\ndiﬀerent.\\nThe subject, who was unaware of the ruse, would\\nimmediately become bewildered. Their eyes would open\\nwide. They would laugh nervously to themselves. They\\nwould double-check the reactions of other participants.\\nTheir agitation would grow as one person after another\\ndelivered the same incorrect response. Soon, the subject\\nbegan to doubt their own eyes. Eventually , they delivered\\nthe answer they knew in their heart to be incorrect.\\nAsch ran this experiment many times and in many\\ndiﬀerent ways. What he discovered was that as the number\\nof actors increased, so did the conformity of the subject. If\\nit was just the subject and one actor , then there was no\\neﬀect on the person’s choice. They just assumed they were\\nin the room with a dummy . When two actors were in the\\nroom with the subject, there was still little impact. But as\\nthe number of people increased to three actors and four\\nand all the way to eight, the subject became more likely to\\nsecond-guess themselves. By the end of the experiment,\\nnearly 75 percent of the subjects had agreed with the\\ngroup answer even though it was obviously incorrect.\\nWhenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the\\ngroup to guide our behavior . We are constantly scanning\\nour environment and wondering, “ What is everyone else\\ndoing?” W e check reviews on Amazon or Y elp or\\nTripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying,\\neating, and travel habits. It’s usually a smart strategy .\\nThere is evidence in numbers.\\nBut there can be a downside.\\nThe normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the\\ndesired behavior of the individual. F or example, one study\\nfound that when a chimpanzee learns an eﬀective way to\\ncrack nuts open as a member of one group and then\\nswitches to a new group that uses a less eﬀective strategy ,\\nit will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to\\nblend in with the rest of the chimps.\\nHumans are similar . There is tremendous internal\\npressure to comply with the norms of the group. The\\nreward of being accepted is often greater than the reward\\nof winning an argument, looking smart, or ﬁnding truth.\\nMost days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be\\nright by ourselves.\\nThe human mind knows how to get along with others. It\\nwants  to get along with others. This is our natural mode.\\nYou can override it—you can choose to ignore the group or\\nto stop caring what other people think—but it takes work.\\nRunning against the grain of your culture requires extra\\neﬀort.\\nWhen changing your habits means challenging the tribe,\\nchange is unattractive. When changing your habits means\\nﬁtting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.\\n3. Imitating the P owerful\\nHumans everywhere pursue power , prestige, and status.\\nWe want pins and medallions on our jackets. W e want\\nPresident or P artner in our titles. W e want to be\\nacknowledged, recognized, and praised. This tendency can\\nseem vain, but overall, it’s a smart move. Historically , a\\nperson with greater power and status has access to more\\nresources, worries less about survival, and proves to be a\\nmore attractive mate.\\nWe are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect,\\napproval, admiration, and status. W e want to be the one in\\nthe gym who can do muscle-ups or the musician who can\\nplay the hardest chord progressions or the parent with the\\nmost accomplished children because these things separate\\nus from the crowd. Once we ﬁt in, we start looking for ways\\nto stand out.\\nThis is one reason we care so much about the habits of\\nhighly eﬀective people. W e try to copy the behavior of\\nsuccessful people because we desire success ourselves.\\nMany of our daily habits are imitations of people we\\nadmire. Y ou replicate the marketing strategies of the most\\nsuccessful ﬁrms in your industry . You make a recipe from\\nyour favorite baker . You borrow the storytelling strategies\\nof your favorite writer . You mimic the communication style\\nof your boss. W e imitate people we envy .\\nHigh-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and\\npraise of others. And that means if a behavior can get us\\napproval, respect, and praise, we ﬁnd it attractive.\\nWe are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would\\nlower our status. W e trim our hedges and mow our lawn\\nbecause we don’t want to be the slob of the neighborhood.\\nWhen our mother comes to visit, we clean up the house\\nbecause we don’t want to be judged. W e are continually\\nwondering “ What will others think of me?” and altering our\\nbehavior based on the answer .\\nThe P olgar sisters—the chess prodigies mentioned at the\\nbeginning of this chapter—are evidence of the powerful\\nand lasting impact social inﬂuences can have on our\\nbehavior . The sisters practiced chess for many hours each\\nday and continued this remarkable eﬀort for decades. But\\nthese habits and behaviors maintained their attractiveness,\\nin part, because they were valued by their culture. From\\nthe praise of their parents to the achievement of diﬀerent\\nstatus markers like becoming a grandmaster , they had\\nmany reasons to continue their eﬀort.\\nChapter Summary\\nThe culture we live in determines which behaviors are\\nattractive to us.\\nWe tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved\\nof by our culture because we have a strong desire to ﬁt\\nin and belong to the tribe.\\nWe tend to imitate the habits of three social groups:\\nthe close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and\\nthe powerful (those with status and prestige).\\nOne of the most eﬀective things you can do to build\\nbetter habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired\\nbehavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already\\nhave something in common with the group.\\nThe normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the\\ndesired behavior of the individual.

I was in the middle of a four-day trip to Turkey\\nand my guide, Mike, was relaxing in a worn-out armchair a\\nfew feet away .\\nMike wasn’t really a guide. He was just a guy from\\nMaine who had been living in Turkey for ﬁve years, but he\\noﬀered to show me around while I was visiting the country\\nand I took him up on it. On this particular night, I had been\\ninvited to dinner with him and a handful of his Turkish\\nfriends.\\nThere were seven of us, and I was the only one who\\nhadn’t, at some point, smoked at least one pack of\\ncigarettes per day . I asked one of the Turks how he got\\nstarted. “Friends,” he said. “It always starts with your\\nfriends. One friend smokes, then you try it.”\\nWhat was truly fascinating was that half of the people in\\nthe room had managed to quit smoking. Mike had been\\nsmoke-free for a few years at that point, and he swore up\\nand down that he broke the habit because of a book called\\nAllen Carr’s Easy W ay to Stop Smoking .\\n“It frees you from the mental burden of smoking,” he\\nsaid. “It tells you: ‘Stop lying to yourself . You know you\\ndon’t actually want to smoke. Y ou know you don’t really\\nenjoy this.’ It helps you feel like you’re not the victim\\nanymore. Y ou start to realize that you don’t need  to\\nsmoke.”\\nI had never tried a cigarette, but I took a look at the\\nbook afterward out of curiosity . The author employs an\\ninteresting strategy to help smokers eliminate their\\ncravings. He systematically reframes each cue associated\\nwith smoking and gives it a new meaning.\\nHe says things like:\\nYou think you are quitting something, but you’re not\\nquitting anything because cigarettes do nothing for\\nyou.\\nYou think smoking is something you need to do to be\\nsocial, but it’s not. Y ou can be social without smoking\\nat all.\\nYou think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’s not.\\nSmoking does not relieve your nerves, it destroys them.\\nOver and over , he repeats these phrases and others like\\nthem. “Get it clearly into your mind,” he says. “ You are\\nlosing nothing and you are making marvelous positive gains\\nnot only in health, energy and money but also in\\nconﬁdence, self -respect, freedom and, most important of\\nall, in the length and quality of your future life.”\\nBy the time you get to the end of the book, smoking\\nseems like the most ridiculous thing in the world to do . And\\nif you no longer expect smoking to bring you any beneﬁts,\\nyou have no reason to smoke. It is an inversion of the 2nd\\nLaw of Behavior Change: make it unattractive .\\nNow, I know this idea might sound overly simplistic. Just\\nchange your mind and you can quit smoking. But stick with\\nme for a minute.\\nWHERE CRA VINGS COME FROM\\nEvery behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper ,\\nunderlying motive. I often have a craving that goes\\nsomething like this: “I want to eat tacos.” If you were to ask\\nme why I want to eat tacos, I wouldn’t say , “Because I need\\nfood to survive.” But the truth is, somewhere deep down, I\\nam motivated to eat tacos because I have to eat to survive.\\nThe underlying motive is to obtain food and water even if\\nmy speciﬁc craving is for a taco .\\nSome of our underlying motives include: *\\nConserve energy\\nObtain food and water\\nFind love and reproduce\\nConnect and bond with others\\nWin social acceptance and approval\\nReduce uncertainty\\nAchieve status and prestige\\nA craving is just a speciﬁc manifestation of a deeper\\nunderlying motive. Y our brain did not evolve with a desire\\nto smoke cigarettes or to check Instagram or to play video\\ngames. A t a deep level, you simply want to reduce\\nuncertainty and relieve anxiety , to win social acceptance\\nand approval, or to achieve status.\\nLook at nearly any product that is habit-forming and\\nyou’ll see that it does not create a new motivation, but\\nrather latches onto the underlying motives of human\\nnature.\\nFind love and reproduce = using Tinder\\nConnect and bond with others = browsing F acebook\\nWin social acceptance and approval = posting on\\nInstagram\\nReduce uncertainty = searching on Google\\nAchieve status and prestige = playing video games\\nYour habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.\\nNew versions of old vices. The underlying motives behind\\nhuman behavior remain the same. The speciﬁc habits we\\nperform diﬀer based on the period of history .\\nHere’s the powerful part: there are many diﬀerent ways\\nto address the same underlying motive. One person might\\nlearn to reduce stress by smoking a cigarette. Another\\nperson learns to ease their anxiety by going for a run. Y our\\ncurrent habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the\\nproblems you face; they are just the methods you learned\\nto use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you\\nneed to solve, you keep coming back to it.\\nHabits are all about associations. These associations\\ndetermine whether we predict a habit to be worth\\nrepeating or not. As we covered in our discussion of the 1st\\nLaw, your brain is continually absorbing information and\\nnoticing cues in the environment. Every time you perceive\\na cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction\\nabout what to do in the next moment.\\nCue: Y ou notice that the stove is hot.\\nPrediction: If I touch it I’ll get burned, so I should avoid\\ntouching it.\\nCue: Y ou see that the traﬀic light turned green.\\nPrediction: If I step on the gas, I’ll make it safely through\\nthe intersection and get closer to my destination, so I\\nshould step on the gas.\\nYou see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and\\ndetermine the appropriate response.\\nThis all happens in an instant, but it plays a crucial role\\nin your habits because every action is preceded by a\\nprediction. Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive.\\nAll day long, you are making your best guess of how to act\\ngiven what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in\\nthe past. Y ou are endlessly predicting what will happen in\\nthe next moment.\\nOur behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions.\\nPut another way , our behavior is heavily dependent on how\\nwe interpret the events that happen to us, not necessarily\\nthe objective reality of the events themselves. T wo people\\ncan look at the same cigarette, and one feels the urge to\\nsmoke while the other is repulsed by the smell. The same\\ncue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on\\nyour prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the\\nprediction that precedes them.\\nThese predictions lead to feelings, which is how we\\ntypically describe a craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge.\\nFeelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and\\nthe predictions we make into a signal that we can apply .\\nThey help explain what we are currently sensing. F or\\ninstance, whether or not you realize it, you are noticing\\nhow warm or cold you feel right now . If the temperature\\ndrops by one degree, you probably won’t do anything. If the\\ntemperature drops ten degrees, however , you’ll feel cold\\nand put on another layer of clothing. F eeling cold was the\\nsignal that prompted you to act. Y ou have been sensing the\\ncues the entire time, but it is only when you predict that\\nyou would be better oﬀ in a diﬀerent state that you take\\naction.\\nA craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the\\ndesire to change your internal state. When the temperature\\nfalls, there is a gap between what your body is currently\\nsensing and what it wants  to be sensing. This gap between\\nyour current state and your desired state provides a reason\\nto act.\\nDesire is the diﬀerence between where you are now and\\nwhere you want to be in the future. Even the tiniest action\\nis tinged with the motivation to feel diﬀerently than you do\\nin the moment. When you binge-eat or light up or browse\\nsocial media, what you really want is not a potato chip or a\\ncigarette or a bunch of likes. What you really want is to feel\\ndiﬀerent.\\nOur feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady\\nin our current state or to make a change. They help us\\ndecide the best course of action. Neurologists have\\ndiscovered that when emotions and feelings are impaired,\\nwe actually lose the ability to make decisions. W e have no\\nsignal of what to pursue and what to avoid. As the\\nneuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion\\nthat allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indiﬀerent.”\\nTo summarize, the speciﬁc cravings you feel and habits\\nyou perform are really an attempt to address your\\nfundamental underlying motives. Whenever a habit\\nsuccessfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to\\ndo it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking\\nsocial media will help you feel loved or that watching\\nYouTube will allow you to forget your fears. Habits are\\nattractive when we associate them with positive feelings,\\nand we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to\\nour detriment.\\nHOW TO REPROGRAM Y OUR BRAIN TO ENJO Y HARD\\nHABITS\\nYou can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn\\nto associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes,\\nall you need is a slight mind-set shift. F or instance, we\\noften talk about everything we have to do in a given day .\\nYou have to wake up early for work. Y ou have to make\\nanother sales call for your business. Y ou have to cook\\ndinner for your family .\\nNow, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have”\\nto. You “get” to .\\nYou get to wake up early for work. Y ou get to make\\nanother sales call for your business. Y ou get to cook dinner\\nfor your family . By simply changing one word, you shift the\\nway you view each event. Y ou transition from seeing these\\nbehaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.\\nThe key point is that both versions of reality are true.\\nYou have  to do those things, and you also get to do them.\\nWe can ﬁnd evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.\\nI once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair .\\nWhen asked if it was diﬀicult being conﬁned, he responded,\\n“I’m not conﬁned to my wheelchair—I am liberated by it. If\\nit wasn’t for my wheelchair , I would be bed-bound and\\nnever able to leave my house.” This shift in perspective\\ncompletely transformed how he lived each day .\\nReframing your habits to highlight their beneﬁts  rather\\nthan their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to\\nreprogram your mind and make a habit seem more\\nattractive.\\nExercise. Many people associate exercise with being a\\nchallenging task that drains energy and wears you down.\\nYou can just as easily view it as a way to develop skills and\\nbuild you up. Instead of telling yourself “I need to go run in\\nthe morning,” say “ It’s time to build endurance and get\\nfast.”\\nFinance.  Saving money is often associated with\\nsacriﬁce. However , you can associate it with freedom\\nrather than limitation if you realize one simple truth: living\\nbelow your current means increases  your future means.\\nThe money you save this month increases your purchasing\\npower next month.\\nMeditation.  Anyone who has tried meditation for more\\nthan three seconds knows how frustrating it can be when\\nthe next distraction inevitably pops into your mind. Y ou can\\ntransform frustration into delight when you realize that\\neach interruption gives you a chance to practice returning\\nto your breath. Distraction is a good thing because you\\nneed distractions to practice meditation.\\nPregame jitters.  Many people feel anxious before\\ndelivering a big presentation or competing in an important\\nevent. They experience quicker breathing, a faster heart\\nrate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these feelings\\nnegatively , then we feel threatened and tense up. If we\\ninterpret these feelings positively , then we can respond\\nwith ﬂuidity and grace. Y ou can reframe “I am nervous” to\\n“I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me\\nconcentrate.”\\nThese little mind-set shifts aren’t magic, but they can\\nhelp change the feelings you associate with a particular\\nhabit or situation.\\nIf you want to take it a step further , you can create a\\nmotivation ritual . You simply practice associating your\\nhabits with something you enjoy , then you can use that cue\\nwhenever you need a bit of motivation. F or instance, if you\\nalways play the same song before having sex, then you’ll\\nbegin to link the music with the act. Whenever you want to\\nget in the mood, just press play .\\nEd Latimore, a boxer and writer from Pittsburgh,\\nbeneﬁted from a similar strategy without knowing it. “Odd\\nrealization,” he wrote. “My focus and concentration goes\\nup just by putting my headphones [on] while writing. I\\ndon’t even have to play any music.” W ithout realizing it, he\\nwas conditioning himself . In the beginning, he put his\\nheadphones on, played some music he enjoyed, and did\\nfocused work. A fter doing it ﬁve, ten, twenty times, putting\\nhis headphones on became a cue that he automatically\\nassociated with increased focus. The craving followed\\nnaturally .\\nAthletes use similar strategies to get themselves in the\\nmind-set to perform. During my baseball career , I\\ndeveloped a speciﬁc ritual of stretching and throwing\\nbefore each game. The whole sequence took about ten\\nminutes, and I did it the same way every single time. While\\nit physically warmed me up to play , more importantly , it put\\nme in the right mental state. I began to associate my\\npregame ritual with feeling competitive and focused. Even\\nif I wasn’t motivated beforehand, by the time I was done\\nwith my ritual, I was in “game mode.”\\nYou can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say\\nyou want to feel happier in general. Find something that\\nmakes you truly happy—like petting your dog or taking a\\nbubble bath—and then create a short routine that you\\nperform every time before  you do the thing you love.\\nMaybe you take three deep breaths and smile.\\nThree deep breaths. Smile. P et the dog. Repeat.\\nEventually , you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-\\nsmile routine with being in a good mood. It becomes a cue\\nthat means  feeling happy . Once established, you can break\\nit out anytime you need to change your emotional state.\\nStressed at work? T ake three deep breaths and smile. Sad\\nabout life? Three deep breaths and smile. Once a habit has\\nbeen built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if it has little\\nto do with the original situation.\\nThe key to ﬁnding and ﬁxing the causes of your bad\\nhabits is to reframe the associations you have about them.\\nIt’s not easy , but if you can reprogram your predictions, you\\ncan transform a hard habit into an attractive one.\\nChapter Summary\\nThe inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is\\nmake it unattractive .\\nEvery behavior has a surface level craving and a\\ndeeper underlying motive.\\nYour habits are modern-day solutions to ancient\\ndesires.\\nThe cause of your habits is actually the prediction that\\nprecedes them.

One hundred photos would rate an A,\\nninety photos a B, eighty photos a C , and so on.\\nMeanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would\\nbe in the “quality” group. They would be graded only on the\\nexcellence of their work. They would only need to produce\\none photo during the semester , but to get an A, it had to be\\na nearly perfect image.\\nAt the end of the term, he was surprised to ﬁnd that all\\nthe best photos were produced by the quantity  group.\\nDuring the semester , these students were busy taking\\nphotos, experimenting with composition and lighting,\\ntesting out various methods in the darkroom, and learning\\nfrom their mistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of\\nphotos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the quality\\ngroup sat around speculating about perfection. In the end,\\nthey had little to show for their eﬀorts other than\\nunveriﬁed theories and one mediocre photo .*\\nIt is easy to get bogged down trying to ﬁnd the optimal\\nplan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best\\nprogram to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle.\\nWe are so focused on ﬁguring out the best approach that\\nwe never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once\\nwrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”\\nI refer to this as the diﬀerence between being in motion\\nand taking action. The two ideas sound similar , but they’re\\nnot the same. When you’re in motion, you’re planning and\\nstrategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but\\nthey don’t produce a result.\\nAction, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that\\nwill deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles\\nI want to write, that’s motion. If I actually sit down and\\nwrite an article, that’s action. If I search for a better diet\\nplan and read a few books on the topic, that’s motion. If I\\nactually eat a healthy meal, that’s action.\\nSometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an\\noutcome by itself . It doesn’t matter how many times you go\\ntalk to the personal trainer , that motion will never get you\\nin shape. Only the action of working out will get the result\\nyou’re looking to achieve.\\nIf motion doesn’t lead to results, why do we do it?\\nSometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or\\nlearn more. But more often than not, we do it because\\nmotion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without\\nrunning the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at\\navoiding criticism. It doesn’t feel good to fail or to be\\njudged publicly , so we tend to avoid situations where that\\nmight happen. And that’s the biggest reason why you slip\\ninto motion rather than taking action: you want to delay\\nfailure.\\nIt’s easy to be in motion and convince yourself that\\nyou’re still making progress. Y ou think, “I’ve got\\nconversations going with four potential clients right now .\\nThis is good. W e’re moving in the right direction.” Or, “I\\nbrainstormed some ideas for that book I want to write. This\\nis coming together .”\\nMotion makes you feel like you’re getting things done.\\nBut really , you’re just preparing to get something done.\\nWhen preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you\\nneed to change something. Y ou don’t want to merely be\\nplanning. Y ou want to be practicing.\\nIf you want to master a habit, the key is to start with\\nrepetition, not perfection. Y ou don’t need to map out every\\nfeature of a new habit. Y ou just need to practice it. This is\\nthe ﬁrst takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your\\nreps in.\\nHOW L ONG DOES IT ACTU ALLY TAKE TO FORM A NEW\\nHABIT?\\nHabit formation is the process by which a behavior\\nbecomes progressively more automatic through repetition.\\nThe more you repeat an activity , the more the structure of\\nyour brain changes to become eﬀicient at that activity .\\nNeuroscientists call this long-term potentiation , which\\nrefers to the strengthening of connections between neurons\\nin the brain based on recent patterns of activity . With each\\nrepetition, cell-to-cell signaling improves and the neural\\nconnections tighten. First described by neuropsychologist\\nDonald Hebb in 1949, this phenomenon is commonly known\\nas Hebb’s Law: “ Neurons that ﬁre together wire together .”\\nRepeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the\\nbrain. In musicians, the cerebellum—critical for physical\\nmovements like plucking a guitar string or pulling a violin\\nbow—is larger than it is in nonmusicians. Mathematicians,\\nmeanwhile, have increased gray matter in the inferior\\nparietal lobule, which plays a key role in computation and\\ncalculation. Its size is directly correlated with the amount\\nof time spent in the ﬁeld; the older and more experienced\\nthe mathematician, the greater the increase in gray matter .\\nWhen scientists analyzed the brains of taxi drivers in\\nLondon, they found that the hippocampus—a region of the\\nbrain involved in spatial memory—was signiﬁcantly larger\\nin their subjects than in non–taxi drivers. Even more\\nfascinating, the hippocampus decreased in size when a\\ndriver retired. Like the muscles of the body responding to\\nregular weight training, particular regions of the brain\\nadapt as they are used and atrophy as they are abandoned.\\nOf course, the importance of repetition in establishing\\nhabits was recognized long before neuroscientists began\\npoking around. In 1860, the English philosopher George H.\\nLewes noted, “In learning to speak a new language, to play\\non a musical instrument, or to perform unaccustomed\\nmovements, great diﬀiculty is felt, because the channels\\nthrough which each sensation has to pass have not become\\nestablished; but no sooner has frequent repetition cut a\\npathway , than this diﬀiculty vanishes; the actions become\\nso automatic that they can be performed while the mind is\\notherwise engaged.” Both common sense and scientiﬁc\\nevidence agree: repetition is a form of change.\\nEach time you repeat an action, you are activating a\\nparticular neural circuit associated with that habit. This\\nmeans that simply putting in your reps is one of the most\\ncritical steps you can take to encoding a new habit. It is\\nwhy the students who took tons of photos improved their\\nskills while those who merely theorized about perfect\\nphotos did not. One group engaged in active practice, the\\nother in passive learning. One in action, the other in\\nmotion.\\nAll habits follow a similar trajectory from eﬀortful\\npractice to automatic behavior , a process known as\\nautomaticity . Automaticity is the ability to perform a\\nbehavior without thinking about each step, which occurs\\nwhen the nonconscious mind takes over .\\nIt looks something like this:\\nTHE HABIT LINE\\nFIGURE 11:  In the beginning (point A), a habit r equir es a good\\ndeal of eﬀort and concentration to perfor m. After a few\\nrepetitions (point B), it gets easier, but still r equir es some\\nconscious attention. W ith enough practice (point C), the habit\\nbecomes mor e automatic than conscious. Beyond this thr eshold\\n—the habit line —the behavior can be done mor e or less without\\nthinking. A new habit has been for med.\\nOn the following page, you’ll see what it looks like when\\nresearchers track the level of automaticity for an actual\\nhabit like walking for ten minutes each day . The shape of\\nthese charts, which scientists call  learning curves , reveals\\nan important truth about behavior change: habits form\\nbased on frequency , not time.\\nWALKING 10 MINUTES PER DA Y\\nFIGURE 12:  This graph shows someone who built the habit of\\nwalking for ten minutes af ter br eakfast each day . Notice that as\\nthe repetitions incr ease, so does automaticity, until the behavior\\nis as easy and automatic as it can be.\\nOne of the most common questions I hear is, “How long\\ndoes it take to build a new habit?” But what people really\\nshould be asking is, “How many  does it take to form a new\\nhabit?” That is, how many repetitions are required to make\\na habit automatic?\\nThere is nothing magical about time passing with regard\\nto habit formation. It doesn’t matter if it’s been twenty-one\\ndays or thirty days or three hundred days. What matters is\\nthe rate at which you perform the behavior . You could do\\nsomething twice in thirty days, or two hundred times. It’s\\nthe frequency that makes the diﬀerence. Y our current\\nhabits have been internalized over the course of hundreds,\\nif not thousands, of repetitions. New habits require the\\nsame level of frequency . You need to string together\\nenough successful attempts until the behavior is ﬁrmly\\nembedded in your mind and you cross the Habit Line.\\nIn practice, it doesn’t really matter how long it takes for\\na habit to become automatic. What matters is that you take\\nthe actions you need to take to make progress. Whether an\\naction is fully automatic is of less importance.\\nTo build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most\\neﬀective way to make practice happen is to adhere to the\\n3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it easy . The chapters\\nthat follow will show you how to do exactly that.\\nChapter Summary\\nThe 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy .\\nThe most eﬀective form of learning is practice, not\\nplanning.\\nFocus on taking action, not being in motion.\\nHabit formation is the process by which a behavior\\nbecomes progressively more automatic through\\nrepetition.\\nThe amount of time you have been performing a habit\\nis not as important as the number of times you have\\nperformed it.\\nI\\n12\\nThe Law of L east Eﬀort\\nN HIS A WARD-WINNING BOOK , Guns, Germs, and Steel ,\\nanthropologist and biologist Jared Diamond points out a\\nsimple fact: diﬀerent continents have diﬀerent shapes. A t\\nﬁrst glance, this statement seems rather obvious and\\nunimportant, but it turns out to have a profound impact on\\nhuman behavior .\\nThe primary axis of the Americas runs from north to\\nsouth. That is, the landmass of North and South America\\ntends to be tall and thin rather than wide and fat. The same\\nis generally true for A frica. Meanwhile, the landmass that\\nmakes up Europe, Asia, and the Middle East is the\\nopposite. This massive stretch of land tends to be more\\neast-west in shape. According to Diamond, this diﬀerence\\nin shape played a signiﬁcant role in the spread of\\nagriculture over the centuries.\\nWhen agriculture began to spread around the globe,\\nfarmers had an easier time expanding along east-west\\nroutes than along north-south ones. This is because\\nlocations along the same latitude generally share similar\\nclimates, amounts of sunlight and rainfall, and changes in\\nseason. These factors allowed farmers in Europe and Asia\\nto domesticate a few crops and grow them along the entire\\nstretch of land from France to China.\\nTHE SHAPE OF HUMAN BEHA VIOR\\nFIGURE 13:  The primary axis of Eur ope and Asia is east-west.\\nThe primary axis of the Americas and A frica is north-south. This\\nleads to a wider range of climates up-and-down the Americas\\nthan acr oss Eur ope and Asia. As a r esult, agricultur e spr ead\\nnearly twice as fast acr oss Eur ope and Asia than it did\\nelsewher e. The behavior of far mers—even acr oss hundr eds or\\nthousands of years—was constrained by the amount of friction\\nin the envir onment.\\nBy comparison, the climate varies greatly when traveling\\nfrom north to south. Just imagine how diﬀerent the weather\\nis in Florida compared to Canada. Y ou can be the most\\ntalented farmer in the world, but it won’t help you grow\\nFlorida oranges in the Canadian winter . Snow is a poor\\nsubstitute for soil. In order to spread crops along north-\\nsouth routes, farmers would need to ﬁnd and domesticate\\nnew plants whenever the climate changed.\\nAs a result, agriculture spread two to three times faster\\nacross Asia and Europe than it did up and down the\\nAmericas. Over the span of centuries, this small diﬀerence\\nhad a very big impact. Increased food production allowed\\nfor more rapid population growth. W ith more people, these\\ncultures were able to build stronger armies and were\\nbetter equipped to develop new technologies. The changes\\nstarted out small—a crop that spread slightly farther , a\\npopulation that grew slightly faster—but compounded into\\nsubstantial diﬀerences over time.\\nThe spread of agriculture provides an example of the 3rd\\nLaw of Behavior Change on a global scale. Conventional\\nwisdom holds that motivation is the key to habit change.\\nMaybe if you really  wanted it, you’d actually do it. But the\\ntruth is, our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is\\nconvenient. And despite what the latest productivity best\\nseller will tell you, this is a smart strategy , not a dumb one.\\nEnergy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it\\nwhenever possible. It is human nature to follow the Law of\\nLeast Eﬀort, which states that when deciding between two\\nsimilar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the\\noption that requires the least amount of work. * For\\nexample, expanding your farm to the east where you can\\ngrow the same crops rather than heading north where the\\nclimate is diﬀerent. Out of all the possible actions we could\\ntake, the one that is realized is the one that delivers the\\nmost value for the least eﬀort. W e are motivated to do what\\nis easy .\\nEvery action requires a certain amount of energy . The\\nmore energy required, the less likely it is to occur . If your\\ngoal is to do a hundred push-ups per day , that’s a lot of\\nenergy! In the beginning, when you’re motivated and\\nexcited, you can muster the strength to get started. But\\nafter a few days, such a massive eﬀort feels exhausting.\\nMeanwhile, sticking to the habit of doing one push-up per\\nday requires almost no energy to get started. And the less\\nenergy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur .\\nLook at any behavior that ﬁlls up much of your life and\\nyou’ll see that it can be performed with very low levels of\\nmotivation. Habits like scrolling on our phones, checking\\nemail, and watching television steal so much of our time\\nbecause they can be performed almost without eﬀort. They\\nare remarkably convenient.\\nIn a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what\\nyou really want. Dieting is an obstacle to getting ﬁt.\\nMeditation is an obstacle to feeling calm. Journaling is an\\nobstacle to thinking clearly . You don’t actually want the\\nhabit itself . What you really want is the outcome the habit\\ndelivers. The greater the obstacle—that is, the more\\ndiﬀicult the habit—the more friction there is between you\\nand your desired end state. This is why it is crucial to make\\nyour habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t\\nfeel like it. If you can make your good habits more\\nconvenient, you’ll be more likely to follow through on them.\\nBut what about all the moments when we seem to do the\\nopposite? If we’re all so lazy , then how do you explain\\npeople accomplishing hard things like raising a child or\\nstarting a business or climbing Mount Everest?\\nCertainly , you are capable of doing very hard things. The\\nproblem is that some days you feel like doing the hard work\\nand some days you feel like giving in. On the tough days,\\nit’s crucial to have as many things working in your favor as\\npossible so that you can overcome the challenges life\\nnaturally throws your way . The less friction you face, the\\neasier it is for your stronger self to emerge. The idea\\nbehind make it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea\\nis to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do things\\nthat payoﬀ in the long run.\\nHOW TO ACHIEVE MORE WITH LES S EFFOR T\\nImagine you are holding a garden hose that is bent in the\\nmiddle. Some water can ﬂow through, but not very much. If\\nyou want to increase the rate at which water passes\\nthrough the hose, you have two options. The ﬁrst option is\\nto crank up the valve and force more water out. The second\\noption is to simply remove the bend in the hose and let\\nwater ﬂow through naturally .\\nTrying to pump up your motivation to stick with a hard\\nhabit is like trying to force water through a bent hose. Y ou\\ncan do it, but it requires a lot of eﬀort and increases the\\ntension in your life. Meanwhile, making your habits simple\\nand easy is like removing the bend in the hose. R ather than\\ntrying to overcome the friction in your life, you reduce it.\\nOne of the most eﬀective ways to reduce the friction\\nassociated with your habits is to practice environment\\ndesign. In Chapter 6, we discussed environment design as a\\nmethod for making cues more obvious, but you can also\\noptimize your environment to make actions easier . For\\nexample, when deciding where to practice a new habit, it is\\nbest to choose a place that is already along the path of your\\ndaily routine. Habits are easier to build when they ﬁt into\\nthe ﬂow of your life. Y ou are more likely to go to the gym if\\nit is on your way to work because stopping doesn’t add\\nmuch friction to your lifestyle. By comparison, if the gym is\\noﬀ the path of your normal commute—even by just a few\\nblocks—now you’re going “out of your way” to get there.\\nPerhaps even more eﬀective is reducing the friction\\nwithin your home or oﬀice. T oo often, we try to start habits\\nin high-friction environments. W e try to follow a strict diet\\nwhile we are out to dinner with friends. W e try to write a\\nbook in a chaotic household. W e try to concentrate while\\nusing a smartphone ﬁlled with distractions. It doesn’t have\\nto be this way . We can remove the points of friction that\\nhold us back. This is precisely what electronics\\nmanufacturers in Japan began to do in the 1970s.\\nIn an article published in the New Y orker  titled “Better\\nAll the Time,” James Suroweicki writes:\\n“Japanese ﬁrms emphasized what came to be known as\\n‘lean production,’ relentlessly looking to remove waste of\\nall kinds from the production process, down to redesigning\\nworkspaces, so workers didn’t have to waste time twisting\\nand turning to reach their tools. The result was that\\nJapanese factories were more eﬀicient and Japanese\\nproducts were more reliable than American ones. In 1974,\\nservice calls for American-made color televisions were ﬁve\\ntimes as common as for Japanese televisions. By 1979, it\\ntook American workers three times as long to assemble\\ntheir sets.”\\nI like to refer to this strategy as addition by subtraction .*\\nThe Japanese companies looked for every point of friction\\nin the manufacturing process and eliminated it. As they\\nsubtracted wasted eﬀort, they added customers and\\nrevenue. Similarly , when we remove the points of friction\\nthat sap our time and energy , we can achieve more with\\nless eﬀort. (This is one reason tidying up can feel so good:\\nwe are simultaneously moving forward and lightening the\\ncognitive load our environment places on us.)\\nIf you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll\\nnotice that one of the things these goods and services do\\nbest is remove little bits of friction from your life. Meal\\ndelivery services reduce the friction of shopping for\\ngroceries. Dating apps reduce the friction of making social\\nintroductions. Ride-sharing services reduce the friction of\\ngetting across town. T ext messaging reduces the friction of\\nsending a letter in the mail.\\nLike a Japanese television manufacturer redesigning\\ntheir workspace to reduce wasted motion, successful\\ncompanies design their products to automate, eliminate, or\\nsimplify as many steps as possible. They reduce the number\\nof ﬁelds on each form. They pare down the number of clicks\\nrequired to create an account. They deliver their products\\nwith easy-to-understand directions or ask their customers\\nto make fewer choices.\\nWhen the ﬁrst voice-activated speakers were released—\\nproducts like Google Home, Amazon Echo, and Apple\\nHomeP od—I asked a friend what he liked about the product\\nhe had purchased. He said it was just easier to say “Play\\nsome country music” than to pull out his phone, open the\\nmusic app, and pick a playlist. Of course, just a few years\\nearlier , having unlimited access to music in your pocket\\nwas a remarkably frictionless behavior compared to driving\\nto the store and buying a CD . Business is a never-ending\\nquest to deliver the same result in an easier fashion.\\nSimilar strategies have been used eﬀectively by\\ngovernments. When the British government wanted to\\nincrease tax collection rates, they switched from sending\\ncitizens to a web page where the tax form could be\\ndownloaded to linking directly to the form. Reducing that\\none step in the process increased the response rate from\\n19.2 percent to 23.4 percent. F or a country like the United\\nKingdom, those percentage points represent millions in tax\\nrevenue.\\nThe central idea is to create an environment where doing\\nthe right thing is as easy as possible. Much of the battle of\\nbuilding better habits comes down to ﬁnding ways to\\nreduce the friction associated with our good habits and\\nincrease the friction associated with our bad ones.\\nPRIME THE ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE USE\\nOswald Nuckols is an IT developer from Natchez,\\nMississippi. He is also someone who understands the power\\nof priming his environment.\\nNuckols dialed in his cleaning habits by following a\\nstrategy he refers to as “resetting the room.” F or instance,\\nwhen he ﬁnishes watching television, he places the remote\\nback on the TV stand, arranges the pillows on the couch,\\nand folds the blanket. When he leaves his car , he throws\\nany trash away . Whenever he takes a shower , he wipes\\ndown the toilet while the shower is warming up. (As he\\nnotes, the “ perfect time to clean the toilet is right before\\nyou wash yourself in the shower anyway .”) The purpose of\\nresetting each room is not simply to clean up after the last\\naction, but to prepare for the next action.\\n“When I walk into a room everything is in its right\\nplace,” Nuckols wrote. “Because I do this every day in\\nevery room, stuﬀ always stays in good shape. . . . P eople\\nthink I work hard but I’m actually really lazy . I’m just\\nproactively lazy . It gives you so much time back.”\\nWhenever you organize a space for its intended purpose,\\nyou are priming it to make the next action easy . For\\ninstance, my wife keeps a box of greeting cards that are\\npresorted by occasion—birthday , sympathy , wedding,\\ngraduation, and more. Whenever necessary , she grabs an\\nappropriate card and sends it oﬀ . She is incredibly good at\\nremembering to send cards because she has reduced the\\nfriction of doing so . For years, I was the opposite. Someone\\nwould have a baby and I would think, “I should send a\\ncard.” But then weeks would pass and by the time I\\nremembered to pick one up at the store, it was too late. The\\nhabit wasn’t easy .\\nThere are many ways to prime your environment so it’s\\nready for immediate use. If you want to cook a healthy\\nbreakfast, place the skillet on the stove, set the cooking\\nspray on the counter , and lay out any plates and utensils\\nyou’ll need the night before. When you wake up, making\\nbreakfast will be easy .\\nWant to draw more? Put your pencils, pens, notebooks,\\nand drawing tools on top of your desk, within easy\\nreach.\\nWant to exercise? Set out your workout clothes, shoes,\\ngym bag, and water bottle ahead of time.\\nWant to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits and\\nvegetables on weekends and pack them in containers,\\nso you have easy access to healthy , ready-to-eat options\\nduring the week.\\nThese are simple ways to make the good habit the path\\nof least resistance.\\nYou can also invert this principle and prime the\\nenvironment to make bad behaviors diﬀicult. If you ﬁnd\\nyourself watching too much television, for example, then\\nunplug it after each use. Only plug it back in if you can say\\nout loud the name of the show you want to watch. This\\nsetup creates just enough friction to prevent mindless\\nviewing.\\nIf that doesn’t do it, you can take it a step further .\\nUnplug the television and take the batteries out of the\\nremote after each use, so it takes an extra ten seconds to\\nturn it back on. And if you’re really hard-core, move the\\ntelevision out of the living room and into a closet after each\\nuse. Y ou can be sure you’ll only take it out when you really\\nwant to watch something. The greater the friction, the less\\nlikely the habit.\\nWhenever possible, I leave my phone in a diﬀerent room\\nuntil lunch. When it’s right next to me, I’ll check it all\\nmorning for no reason at all. But when it is in another\\nroom, I rarely think about it. And the friction is high\\nenough that I won’t go get it without a reason. As a result, I\\nget three to four hours each morning when I can work\\nwithout interruption.\\nIf sticking your phone in another room doesn’t seem like\\nenough, tell a friend or family member to hide it from you\\nfor a few hours. Ask a coworker to keep it at their desk in\\nthe morning and give it back to you at lunch.\\nIt is remarkable how little friction is required to prevent\\nunwanted behavior . When I hide beer in the back of the\\nfridge where I can’t see it, I drink less. When I delete social\\nmedia apps from my phone, it can be weeks before I\\ndownload them again and log in. These tricks are unlikely\\nto curb a true addiction, but for many of us, a little bit of\\nfriction can be the diﬀerence between sticking with a good\\nhabit or sliding into a bad one. Imagine the cumulative\\nimpact of making dozens of these changes and living in an\\nenvironment designed to make the good behaviors easier\\nand the bad behaviors harder .\\nWhether we are approaching behavior change as an\\nindividual, a parent, a coach, or a leader , we should ask\\nourselves the same question: “How can we design a world\\nwhere it’s easy to do what’s right?” Redesign your life so\\nthe actions that matter most are also the actions that are\\neasiest to do .\\nChapter Summary\\nHuman behavior follows the Law of Least Eﬀort. W e\\nwill naturally gravitate toward the option that requires\\nthe least amount of work.\\nCreate an environment where doing the right thing is\\nas easy as possible.\\nReduce the friction associated with good behaviors.\\nWhen friction is low , habits are easy .\\nIncrease the friction associated with bad behaviors.\\nWhen friction is high, habits are diﬀicult.\\nPrime your environment to make future actions easier .\\nT\\n13\\nHow to Stop P rocrastinating by Using the T wo-Minute\\nRule\\nWYLA THARP IS widely regarded as one of the greatest\\ndancers and choreographers of the modern era. In\\n1992, she was awarded a MacArthur F ellowship, often\\nreferred to as the Genius Grant, and she has spent the bulk\\nof her career touring the globe to perform her original\\nworks. She also credits much of her success to simple daily\\nhabits.\\n“I begin each day of my life with a ritual,” she writes. “I\\nwake up at 5:30 A.M., put on my workout clothes, my leg\\nwarmers, my sweat shirt, and my hat. I walk outside my\\nManhattan home, hail a taxi, and tell the driver to take me\\nto the Pumping Iron gym at 91st Street and First A venue,\\nwhere I work out for two hours.\\n“The ritual is not the stretching and weight training I put\\nmy body through each morning at the gym; the ritual is the\\ncab. The moment I tell the driver where to go I have\\ncompleted the ritual.\\n“It’s a simple act, but doing it the same way each\\nmorning habitualizes it—makes it repeatable, easy to do . It\\nreduces the chance that I would skip it or do it diﬀerently .\\nIt is one more item in my arsenal of routines, and one less\\nthing to think about.”\\nHailing a cab each morning may be a tiny action, but it is\\na splendid example of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.\\nResearchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our\\nactions on any given day are done out of habit. This is\\nalready a substantial percentage, but the true inﬂuence of\\nyour habits is even greater than these numbers suggest.\\nHabits are automatic choices that inﬂuence the conscious\\ndecisions that follow . Yes, a habit can be completed in just a\\nfew seconds, but it can also shape the actions that you take\\nfor minutes or hours afterward.\\nHabits are like the entrance ramp to a highway . They\\nlead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re\\nspeeding toward the next behavior . It seems to be easier to\\ncontinue what you are already doing than to start doing\\nsomething diﬀerent. Y ou sit through a bad movie for two\\nhours. Y ou keep snacking even when you’re already full.\\nYou check your phone for “just a second” and soon you\\nhave spent twenty minutes staring at the screen. In this\\nway, the habits you follow without thinking often determine\\nthe choices you make when you are thinking.\\nEach evening, there is a tiny moment—usually around\\n5:15 p.m.—that shapes the rest of my night. My wife walks\\nin the door from work and either we change into our\\nworkout clothes and head to the gym or we crash onto the\\ncouch, order Indian food, and watch The Oﬀice .* Similar to\\nTwyla Tharp hailing the cab, the ritual is changing into my\\nworkout clothes. If I change clothes, I know the workout\\nwill happen. Everything that follows—driving to the gym,\\ndeciding which exercises to do, stepping under the bar—is\\neasy once I’ve taken the ﬁrst step.\\nEvery day , there are a handful of moments that deliver\\nan outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as decisive\\nmoments . The moment you decide between ordering\\ntakeout or cooking dinner . The moment you choose\\nbetween driving your car or riding your bike. The moment\\nyou decide between starting your homework or grabbing\\nthe video game controller . These choices are a fork in the\\nroad.\\nDECISIVE MOMENTS\\nFIGURE 14:  The diﬀer ence between a good day and a bad day is\\noften a few pr oductive and healthy choices made at decisive\\nmoments. Each one is lik e a fork in the r oad, and these choices\\nstack up thr oughout the day and can ultimately lead to very\\ndiﬀer ent outcomes.\\nDecisive moments set the options available to your future\\nself. For instance, walking into a restaurant is a decisive\\nmoment because it determines what you’ll be eating for\\nlunch. T echnically , you are in control of what you order , but\\nin a larger sense, you can only order an item if it is on the\\nmenu. If you walk into a steakhouse, you can get a sirloin\\nor a rib eye, but not sushi. Y our options are constrained by\\nwhat’s available. They are shaped by the ﬁrst choice.\\nWe are limited by where our habits lead us. This is why\\nmastering the decisive moments throughout your day is so\\nimportant. Each day is made up of many moments, but it is\\nreally a few habitual choices that determine the path you\\ntake. These little choices stack up, each one setting the\\ntrajectory for how you spend the next chunk of time.\\nHabits are the entry point, not the end point. They are\\nthe cab, not the gym.\\nTHE TWO -MINUTE RULE\\nEven when you know you should start small, it’s easy to\\nstart too big. When you dream about making a change,\\nexcitement inevitably takes over and you end up trying to\\ndo too much too soon. The most eﬀective way I know to\\ncounteract this tendency is to use the  Two-Minute Rule ,\\nwhich states, “ When you start a new habit, it should take\\nless than two minutes to do .”\\nYou’ll ﬁnd that nearly any habit can be scaled down into\\na two-minute version:\\n“Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one\\npage.”\\n“Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “T ake out my\\nyoga mat.”\\n“Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”\\n“Fold the laundry” becomes “F old one pair of socks.”\\n“Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”\\nThe idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to\\nstart. Anyone can meditate for one minute, read one page,\\nor put one item of clothing away . And, as we have just\\ndiscussed, this is a powerful strategy because once you’ve\\nstarted doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue\\ndoing it. A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The\\nactions that follow  can be challenging, but the ﬁrst two\\nminutes should be easy . What you want is a “gateway\\nhabit” that naturally leads you down a more productive\\npath.\\nYou can usually ﬁgure out the gateway habits that will\\nlead to your desired outcome by mapping out your goals on\\na scale from “very easy” to “very hard.” F or instance,\\nrunning a marathon is very hard. Running a 5K is hard.\\nWalking ten thousand steps is moderately diﬀicult. W alking\\nten minutes is easy . And putting on your running shoes is\\nvery easy . Your goal might be to run a marathon, but your\\ngateway habit is to put on your running shoes. That’s how\\nyou follow the T wo-Minute Rule.\\nVery easy Easy Moderate HardVery\\nhard\\nPut on your\\nrunning shoesWalk ten\\nminutesWalk ten\\nthousand\\nstepsRun a 5KRun a\\nmarathon\\nWrite one\\nsentenceWrite one\\nparagraphWrite one\\nthousand\\nwordsWrite a ﬁve-\\nthousand-wor d\\narticleWrite a\\nbook\\nOpen your\\nnotesStudy for\\nten minutesStudy for\\nthree hoursGet straight A’sEarn a\\nPhD\\nPeople often think it’s weird to get hyped about reading\\none page or meditating for one minute or making one sales\\ncall. But the point is not to do one thing. The point is to\\nmaster the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must\\nbe established before it can be improved. If you can’t learn\\nthe basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of\\nmastering the ﬁner details. Instead of trying to engineer a\\nperfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more\\nconsistent basis. Y ou have to standardize before you can\\noptimize.\\nAs you master the art of showing up, the ﬁrst two\\nminutes simply become a ritual at the beginning of a larger\\nroutine. This is not merely a hack to make habits easier but\\nactually the ideal way to master a diﬀicult skill. The more\\nyou ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it\\nbecomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that\\nis required to do great things. By doing the same warm-up\\nbefore every workout, you make it easier to get into a state\\nof peak performance. By following the same creative ritual,\\nyou make it easier to get into the hard work of creating. By\\ndeveloping a consistent power-down habit, you make it\\neasier to get to bed at a reasonable time each night. Y ou\\nmay not be able to automate the whole process, but you\\ncan make the ﬁrst action mindless. Make it easy to start\\nand the rest will follow .\\nThe T wo-Minute Rule can seem like a trick to some\\npeople. Y ou know that the real goal is to do more than just\\ntwo minutes, so it may feel like you’re trying to fool\\nyourself . Nobody is actually aspiring to read one page or do\\none push-up or open their notes. And if you know it’s a\\nmental trick, why would you fall for it?\\nIf the T wo-Minute Rule feels forced, try this: do it for two\\nminutes and then stop. Go for a run, but you must  stop\\nafter two minutes. Start meditating, but you must  stop after\\ntwo minutes. Study Arabic, but you must  stop after two\\nminutes. It’s not a strategy for starting, it’s the whole\\nthing. Y our habit can only last one hundred and twenty\\nseconds.\\nOne of my readers used this strategy to lose over one\\nhundred pounds. In the beginning, he went to the gym each\\nday, but he told himself he wasn’t allowed to stay for more\\nthan ﬁve minutes. He would go to the gym, exercise for ﬁve\\nminutes, and leave as soon as his time was up. A fter a few\\nweeks, he looked around and thought, “ Well, I’m always\\ncoming here anyway . I might as well start staying a little\\nlonger .” A few years later , the weight was gone.\\nJournaling provides another example. Nearly everyone\\ncan beneﬁt from getting their thoughts out of their head\\nand onto paper , but most people give up after a few days or\\navoid it entirely because journaling feels like a chore. * The\\nsecret is to always stay below the point where it feels like\\nwork. Greg McK eown, a leadership consultant from the\\nUnited Kingdom, built a daily journaling habit by\\nspeciﬁcally writing less than he felt like. He always stopped\\njournaling before it seemed like a hassle. Ernest\\nHemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of\\nwriting. “The best way is to always stop when you are\\ngoing good,” he said.\\nStrategies like this work for another reason, too: they\\nreinforce the identity you want to build. If you show up at\\nthe gym ﬁve days in a row—even if it’s just for two minutes\\n—you are casting votes for your new identity . You’re not\\nworried about getting in shape. Y ou’re focused on\\nbecoming the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts.\\nYou’re taking the smallest action that conﬁrms the type of\\nperson you want to be.\\nWe rarely think about change this way because everyone\\nis consumed by the end goal. But one push-up is better\\nthan not exercising. One minute of guitar practice is better\\nthan none at all. One minute of reading is better than never\\npicking up a book. It’s better to do less than you hoped\\nthan to do nothing at all.\\nAt some point, once you’ve established the habit and\\nyou’re showing up each day , you can combine the T wo-\\nMinute Rule with a technique we call habit shaping  to scale\\nyour habit back up toward your ultimate goal. Start by\\nmastering the ﬁrst two minutes of the smallest version of\\nthe behavior . Then, advance to an intermediate step and\\nrepeat the process—focusing on just the ﬁrst two minutes\\nand mastering that stage before moving on to the next\\nlevel. Eventually , you’ll end up with the habit you had\\noriginally hoped to build while still keeping your focus\\nwhere it should be: on the ﬁrst two minutes of the behavior .\\nEXAMPLES OF HABIT SHAPING\\nBecoming an Early Riser\\nPhase 1: Be home by 10 p.m. every night.\\nPhase 2: Have all devices (TV, phone, etc.) tur ned oﬀ by 10 p.m. every night.\\nPhase 3: Be in bed by 10 p.m. every night (r eading a book, talking with your\\npartner).\\nPhase 4: Lights oﬀ by 10 p.m. every night.\\nPhase 5: Wake up at 6 a.m. every day .\\nBecoming V egan\\nPhase 1: Start eating vegetables at each meal.\\nPhase 2: Stop eating animals with four legs (cow, pig, lamb, etc.).\\nPhase 3: Stop eating animals with two legs (chick en, turk ey, etc.).\\nPhase 4: Stop eating animals with no legs (ﬁsh, clams, scallops, etc.).\\nPhase 5: Stop eating all animal pr oducts (eggs, milk, cheese).\\nStarting to Exercise\\nPhase 1: Change into work out clothes.\\nPhase 2: Step out the door (try taking a walk).\\nPhase 3: Drive to the gym, e xercise for ﬁve minutes, and leave.\\nPhase 4: Exercise for ﬁf teen minutes at least once per week.\\nPhase 5: Exercise thr ee times per week.\\nNearly any larger life goal can be transformed into a\\ntwo-minute behavior .

T welve months earlier , the French\\nauthor had promised his publisher a new book. But instead\\nof writing, he spent that year pursuing other projects,\\nentertaining guests, and delaying his work. Frustrated,\\nHugo’s publisher responded by setting a deadline less than\\nsix months away . The book had to be ﬁnished by F ebruary\\n1831.\\nHugo concocted a strange plan to beat his\\nprocrastination. He collected all of his clothes and asked an\\nassistant to lock them away in a large chest. He was left\\nwith nothing to wear except a large shawl. Lacking any\\nsuitable clothing to go outdoors, he remained in his study\\nand wrote furiously during the fall and winter of 1830. The\\nHunchback of Notre Dame  was published two weeks early\\non January 14, 1831. *\\nSometimes success is less about making good habits\\neasy and more about making bad habits hard. This is an\\ninversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it\\ndiﬀicult . If you ﬁnd yourself continually struggling to follow\\nthrough on your plans, then you can take a page from\\nVictor Hugo and make your bad habits more diﬀicult by\\ncreating what psychologists call a commitment device .\\nA commitment device is a choice you make in the present\\nthat controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock\\nin future behavior , bind you to good habits, and restrict you\\nfrom bad ones. When V ictor Hugo shut his clothes away so\\nhe could focus on writing, he was creating a commitment\\ndevice. *\\nThere are many ways to create a commitment device.\\nYou can reduce overeating by purchasing food in individual\\npackages rather than in bulk size. Y ou can voluntarily ask\\nto be added to the banned list at casinos and online poker\\nsites to prevent future gambling sprees. I’ve even heard of\\nathletes who have to “make weight” for a competition\\nchoosing to leave their wallets at home during the week\\nbefore weigh-in so they won’t be tempted to buy fast food.\\nAs another example, my friend and fellow habits expert\\nNir Eyal purchased an outlet timer , which is an adapter\\nthat he plugged in between his internet router and the\\npower outlet. A t 10 p.m. each night, the outlet timer cuts\\noﬀ the power to the router . When the internet goes oﬀ ,\\neveryone knows it is time to go to bed.\\nCommitment devices are useful because they enable you\\nto take advantage of good intentions before you can fall\\nvictim to temptation. Whenever I’m looking to cut calories,\\nfor example, I will ask the waiter to split my meal and box\\nhalf of it to go before  the meal is served. If I waited until\\nthe meal came out and told myself “I’ll just eat half ,” it\\nwould never work.\\nThe key is to change the task such that it requires more\\nwork to get out of the good habit than to get started on it.\\nIf you’re feeling motivated to get in shape, schedule a yoga\\nsession and pay ahead of time. If you’re excited about the\\nbusiness you want to start, email an entrepreneur you\\nrespect and set up a consulting call. When the time comes\\nto act, the only way to bail is to cancel the meeting, which\\nrequires eﬀort and may cost money .\\nCommitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the\\nright thing in the future by making bad habits diﬀicult in\\nthe present. However , we can do even better . We can make\\ngood habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.\\nHOW TO A UTOMA TE A HABIT AND NEVER THINK\\nABOUT IT AGAIN\\nJohn Henry P atterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1844.\\nHe spent his childhood doing chores on the family farm and\\nworking shifts at his father’s sawmill. A fter attending\\ncollege at Dartmouth, P atterson returned to Ohio and\\nopened a small supply store for coal miners.\\nIt seemed like a good opportunity . The store faced little\\ncompetition and enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but\\nstill struggled to make money . That was when P atterson\\ndiscovered his employees were stealing from him.\\nIn the mid-1800s, employee theft was a common\\nproblem. Receipts were kept in an open drawer and could\\neasily be altered or discarded. There were no video\\ncameras to review behavior and no software to track\\ntransactions. Unless you were willing to hover over your\\nemployees every minute of the day , or to manage all\\ntransactions yourself , it was diﬀicult to prevent theft.\\nAs Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came\\nacross an advertisement for a new invention called Ritty’s\\nIncorruptible Cashier . Designed by fellow Dayton resident\\nJames Ritty , it was the ﬁrst cash register . The machine\\nautomatically locked the cash and receipts inside after each\\ntransaction. P atterson bought two for ﬁfty dollars each.\\nEmployee theft at his store vanished overnight. In the\\nnext six months, Patterson’s business went from losing\\nmoney to making $5,000 in proﬁt—the equivalent of more\\nthan $100,000 today .\\nPatterson was so impressed with the machine that he\\nchanged businesses. He bought the rights to Ritty’s\\ninvention and opened the National Cash Register Company .\\nTen years later , National Cash Register had over one\\nthousand employees and was on its way to becoming one of\\nthe most successful businesses of its time.\\nThe best way to break a bad habit is to make it\\nimpractical to do . Increase the friction until you don’t even\\nhave the option to act. The brilliance of the cash register\\nwas that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing\\npractically impossible. R ather than trying to change the\\nemployees, it made the preferred behavior automatic.\\nSome actions—like installing a cash register—pay oﬀ\\nagain and again. These onetime choices require a little bit\\nof eﬀort up front but create increasing value over time. I’m\\nfascinated by the idea that a single choice can deliver\\nreturns again and again, and I surveyed my readers on\\ntheir favorite onetime actions that lead to better long-term\\nhabits. The table on the following page shares some of the\\nmost popular answers.\\nI’d wager that if the average person were to simply do\\nhalf of the onetime actions on this list—even if they didn’t\\ngive another thought to their habits—most would ﬁnd\\nthemselves living a better life a year from now . These\\nonetime actions are a straightforward way to employ the\\n3rd Law of Behavior Change. They make it easier to sleep\\nwell, eat healthy , be productive, save money , and generally\\nlive better .\\nONETIME ACTIONS THA T LOCK IN GOOD HABITS\\nNutrition\\nBuy a water ﬁlter to clean your drinking water .\\nUse smaller plates to r educe caloric intak e.\\nSleep\\nBuy a good mattr ess.\\nGet black out curtains.\\nRemove your television fr om your bedr oom.\\nProductivity\\nUnsubscribe fr om emails.\\nTurn oﬀ notiﬁcations and mute gr oup chats.\\nSet your phone to silent.\\nUse email ﬁlters to clear up your inbo x.\\nDelete games and social media apps on your phone.\\nHappiness\\nGet a dog.\\nMove to a friendly, social neighbor hood.\\nGeneral Health\\nGet vaccinated.\\nBuy good shoes to avoid back pain.\\nBuy a supportive chair or standing desk.\\nFinance\\nEnroll in an automatic savings plan.\\nSet up automatic bill pay .\\nCut cable service.\\nAsk service pr oviders to lower your bills.\\nOf course, there are many ways to automate good habits\\nand eliminate bad ones. Typically , they involve putting\\ntechnology to work for you. T echnology can transform\\nactions that were once hard, annoying, and complicated\\ninto behaviors that are easy , painless, and simple. It is the\\nmost reliable and eﬀective way to guarantee the right\\nbehavior .\\nThis is particularly useful for behaviors that happen too\\ninfrequently to become habitual. Things you have to do\\nmonthly or yearly—like rebalancing your investment\\nportfolio—are never repeated frequently enough to become\\na habit, so they beneﬁt in particular from technology\\n“remembering” to do them for you.\\nOther examples include:\\nMedicine: Prescriptions can be automatically reﬁlled.\\nPersonal ﬁnance: Employees can save for retirement\\nwith an automatic wage deduction.\\nCooking: Meal-delivery services can do your grocery\\nshopping.\\nProductivity: Social media browsing can be cut oﬀ with\\na website blocker .\\nWhen you automate as much of your life as possible, you\\ncan spend your eﬀort on the tasks machines cannot do yet.\\nEach habit that we hand over to the authority of technology\\nfrees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of\\ngrowth. As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North\\nWhitehead wrote, “ Civilization advances by extending the\\nnumber of operations we can perform without thinking\\nabout them.”\\nOf course, the power of technology can work against us\\nas well. Binge-watching becomes a habit because you have\\nto put more eﬀort in to stop looking at the screen than to\\ncontinue doing so . Instead of pressing a button to advance\\nto the next episode, Netﬂix or Y ouTube will autoplay it for\\nyou. All you have to do is keep your eyes open.\\nTechnology creates a level of convenience that enables\\nyou to act on your smallest whims and desires. A t the mere\\nsuggestion of hunger , you can have food delivered to your\\ndoor. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can get lost in\\nthe vast expanse of social media. When the eﬀort required\\nto act on your desires becomes eﬀectively zero, you can\\nﬁnd yourself slipping into whatever impulse arises at the\\nmoment. The downside of automation is that we can ﬁnd\\nourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without\\nmaking time for more diﬀicult, but ultimately more\\nrewarding, work.\\nI often ﬁnd myself gravitating toward social media\\nduring any downtime. If I feel bored for just a fraction of a\\nsecond, I reach for my phone. It’s easy to write oﬀ these\\nminor distractions as “just taking a break,” but over time\\nthey can accumulate into a serious issue. The constant tug\\nof “just one more minute” can prevent me from doing\\nanything of consequence. (I’m not the only one. The\\naverage person spends over two hours per day on social\\nmedia. What could you do with an extra six hundred hours\\nper year?)\\nDuring the year I was writing this book, I experimented\\nwith a new time management strategy . Every Monday , my\\nassistant would reset the passwords on all my social media\\naccounts, which logged me out on each device. All week I\\nworked without distraction. On Friday , she would send me\\nthe new passwords. I had the entire weekend to enjoy what\\nsocial media had to oﬀer until Monday morning when she\\nwould do it again. (If you don’t have an assistant, team up\\nwith a friend or family member and reset each other’s\\npasswords each week.)\\nOne of the biggest surprises was how quickly I adapted.\\nWithin the ﬁrst week of locking myself out of social media, I\\nrealized that I didn’t need to check it nearly as often as I\\nhad been, and I certainly didn’t need it each day . It had\\nsimply been so easy that it had become the default. Once\\nmy bad habit became impossible, I discovered that I did\\nactually have the motivation to work on more meaningful\\ntasks. A fter I removed the mental candy from my\\nenvironment, it became much easier to eat the healthy\\nstuﬀ.\\nWhen working in your favor , automation can make your\\ngood habits inevitable and your bad habits impossible. It is\\nthe ultimate way to lock in future behavior rather than\\nrelying on willpower in the moment. By utilizing\\ncommitment devices, strategic onetime decisions, and\\ntechnology , you can create an environment of inevitability—\\na space where good habits are not just an outcome you\\nhope for but an outcome that is virtually guaranteed.\\nChapter Summary\\nThe inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is\\nmake it diﬀicult .\\nA commitment device is a choice you make in the\\npresent that locks in better behavior in the future.\\nThe ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to\\nautomate your habits.\\nOnetime choices—like buying a better mattress or\\nenrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single\\nactions that automate your future habits and deliver\\nincreasing returns over time.\\nUsing technology to automate your habits is the most\\nreliable and eﬀective way to guarantee the right\\nbehavior .\\nHOW TO CREA TE A GOOD HABIT\\nThe 1st Law: Mak e It Obvious\\n1.1: Fill out the Habits Scor ecard.

It was the\\neconomic center of P akistan and a transportation hub, with\\nsome of the most active airports and seaports in the region.\\nIn the commercial parts of town, you could ﬁnd all of the\\nstandard urban amenities and bustling downtown streets.\\nBut Karachi was also one of the least  livable cities in the\\nworld.\\nOver 60 percent of Karachi’s residents lived in squatter\\nsettlements and slums. These densely packed\\nneighborhoods were ﬁlled with makeshift houses cobbled\\ntogether from old boards, cinder blocks, and other\\ndiscarded materials. There was no waste removal system,\\nno electricity grid, no clean water supply . When dry , the\\nstreets were a combination of dust and trash. When wet,\\nthey became a muddy pit of sewage. Mosquito colonies\\nthrived in pools of stagnant water , and children played\\namong the garbage.\\nThe unsanitary conditions lead to widespread illness and\\ndisease. Contaminated water sources caused epidemics of\\ndiarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Nearly one third of\\nthe children living there were malnourished. W ith so many\\npeople crammed into such a small space, viruses and\\nbacterial infections spread rapidly . It was this public health\\ncrisis that had brought Stephen Luby to P akistan.\\nLuby and his team realized that in an environment with\\npoor sanitation, the simple habit of washing your hands\\ncould make a real diﬀerence in the health of the residents.\\nBut they soon discovered that many people were already\\naware that handwashing was important.\\nAnd yet, despite this knowledge, many residents were\\nwashing their hands in a haphazard fashion. Some people\\nwould just run their hands under the water quickly . Others\\nwould only wash one hand. Many would simply forget to\\nwash their hands before preparing food. Everyone said\\nhandwashing was important, but few people made a habit\\nout of it. The problem wasn’t knowledge. The problem was\\nconsistency .\\nThat was when Luby and his team partnered with\\nProcter & Gamble to supply the neighborhood with\\nSafeguard soap. Compared to your standard bar of soap,\\nusing Safeguard was a more enjoyable experience.\\n“In Pakistan, Safeguard was a premium soap,” Luby told\\nme. “The study participants commonly mentioned how\\nmuch they liked it.” The soap foamed easily , and people\\nwere able to lather their hands with suds. It smelled great.\\nInstantly , handwashing became slightly more pleasurable.\\n“I see the goal of handwashing promotion not as\\nbehavior change but as habit adoption,” Luby said. “It is a\\nlot easier for people to adopt a product that provides a\\nstrong positive sensory signal, for example the mint taste of\\ntoothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does not provide\\npleasurable sensory feedback, like ﬂossing one’s teeth. The\\nmarketing team at Procter & Gamble talked about trying to\\ncreate a positive handwashing experience.”\\nWithin months, the researchers saw a rapid shift in the\\nhealth of children in the neighborhood. The rate of diarrhea\\nfell by 52 percent; pneumonia by 48 percent; and impetigo,\\na bacterial skin infection, by 35 percent.\\nThe long-term eﬀects were even better . “We went back\\nto some of the households in Karachi six years after ,” Luby\\ntold me. “ Over 95 percent of households who had been\\ngiven the soap for free and encouraged to wash their hands\\nhad a handwashing station with soap and water available\\nwhen our study team visited. . . . W e had not given any soap\\nto the intervention group for over ﬁve years, but during the\\ntrial they had become so habituated to wash their hands,\\nthat they had maintained the practice.” It was a powerful\\nexample of the fourth and ﬁnal Law of Behavior Change:\\nmake it satisfying.\\nWe are more likely to repeat a behavior when the\\nexperience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. F eelings of\\npleasure—even minor ones like washing your hands with\\nsoap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell\\nthe brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.”\\nPleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth\\nremembering and repeating.\\nTake the story of chewing gum. Chewing gum had been\\nsold commercially throughout the 1800s, but it wasn’t until\\nWrigley launched in 1891 that it became a worldwide habit.\\nEarly versions were made from relatively bland resins—\\nchewy , but not tasty . Wrigley revolutionized the industry by\\nadding ﬂavors like Spearmint and Juicy Fruit, which made\\nthe product ﬂavorful and fun to use. Then they went a step\\nfurther and began pushing chewing gum as a pathway to a\\nclean mouth. Advertisements told readers to “Refresh Y our\\nTaste.”\\nTasty ﬂavors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided\\nlittle bits of immediate reinforcement and made the\\nproduct satisfying to use. Consumption skyrocketed, and\\nWrigley became the largest chewing gum company in the\\nworld.\\nToothpaste had a similar trajectory . Manufacturers\\nenjoyed great success when they added ﬂavors like\\nspearmint, peppermint, and cinnamon to their products.\\nThese ﬂavors don’t improve the eﬀectiveness of toothpaste.\\nThey simply create a “clean mouth” feel and make the\\nexperience of brushing your teeth more pleasurable. My\\nwife actually stopped using Sensodyne because she didn’t\\nlike the aftertaste. She switched to a brand with a stronger\\nmint ﬂavor , which proved to be more satisfying.\\nConversely , if an experience is not satisfying, we have\\nlittle reason to repeat it. In my research, I came across the\\nstory of a woman who had a narcissistic relative who drove\\nher nuts. In an attempt to spend less time with this\\negomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible\\nwhenever he was around. W ithin a few encounters, he\\nstarted avoiding her because he found her so uninteresting.\\nStories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of\\nBehavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is\\npunished is avoided.  You learn what to do in the future\\nbased on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished\\nfor doing) in the past. P ositive emotions cultivate habits.\\nNegative emotions destroy them.\\nThe ﬁrst three laws of behavior change— make it obvious,\\nmake it attractive, and make it easy —increase the odds\\nthat a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law\\nof behavior change— make it satisfying —increases the odds\\nthat a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the\\nhabit loop.\\nBut there is a trick. W e are not looking for just any type\\nof satisfaction. W e are looking for immediate satisfaction.\\nTHE MISMA TCH BETWEEN IMMEDIA TE AND DELA YED\\nREWARDS\\nImagine you’re an animal roaming the plains of A frica—a\\ngiraﬀe or an elephant or a lion. On any given day , most of\\nyour decisions have an immediate impact. Y ou are always\\nthinking about what to eat or where to sleep or how to\\navoid a predator . You are constantly focused on the present\\nor the very near future. Y ou live in what scientists call an\\nimmediate-return environment  because your actions\\ninstantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes.\\nNow switch back to your human self . In modern society ,\\nmany of the choices you make today will not beneﬁt you\\nimmediately . If you do a good job at work, you’ll get a\\npaycheck in a few weeks. If you exercise today , perhaps you\\nwon’t be overweight next year . If you save money now ,\\nmaybe you’ll have enough for retirement decades from\\nnow. You live in what scientists call a delayed-return\\nenvironment  because you can work for years before your\\nactions deliver the intended payoﬀ .\\nThe human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-\\nreturn environment. The earliest remains of modern\\nhumans, known as Homo sapiens sapiens , are\\napproximately two hundred thousand years old. These were\\nthe ﬁrst humans to have a brain relatively similar to ours.\\nIn particular , the neocortex—the newest part of the brain\\nand the region responsible for higher functions like\\nlanguage—was roughly the same size two hundred\\nthousand years ago as today . You are walking around with\\nthe same hardware as your P aleolithic ancestors.\\nIt is only recently—during the last ﬁve hundred years or\\nso—that society has shifted to a predominantly delayed-\\nreturn environment. * Compared to the age of the brain,\\nmodern society is brand-new . In the last one hundred years,\\nwe have seen the rise of the car , the airplane, the\\ntelevision, the personal computer , the internet, the\\nsmartphone, and Beyoncé. The world has changed much in\\nrecent years, but human nature has changed little.\\nSimilar to other animals on the A frican savannah, our\\nancestors spent their days responding to grave threats,\\nsecuring the next meal, and taking shelter from a storm. It\\nmade sense to place a high value on instant gratiﬁcation.\\nThe distant future was less of a concern. And after\\nthousands of generations in an immediate-return\\nenvironment, our brains evolved to prefer quick payoﬀs to\\nlong-term ones.\\nBehavioral economists refer to this tendency as time\\ninconsistency . That is, the way your brain evaluates\\nrewards is inconsistent across time. * You value the present\\nmore than the future. Usually , this tendency serves us well.\\nA reward that is certain  right now is typically worth more\\nthan one that is merely possible  in the future. But\\noccasionally , our bias toward instant gratiﬁcation causes\\nproblems.\\nWhy would someone smoke if they know it increases the\\nrisk of lung cancer? Why would someone overeat when they\\nknow it increases their risk of obesity? Why would someone\\nhave unsafe sex if they know it can result in sexually\\ntransmitted disease? Once you understand how the brain\\nprioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the\\nconsequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards\\nare immediate. Smoking might kill you in ten years, but it\\nreduces stress and eases your nicotine cravings now.\\nOvereating is harmful in the long run but appetizing in the\\nmoment. Sex—safe or not—provides pleasure right away .\\nDisease and infection won’t show up for days or weeks,\\neven years.\\nEvery habit produces multiple outcomes across time.\\nUnfortunately , these outcomes are often misaligned. W ith\\nour bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good,\\nbut the ultimate outcome feels bad. W ith good habits, it is\\nthe reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the\\nultimate outcome feels good. The French economist\\nFrédéric Bastiat explained the problem clearly when he\\nwrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate\\nconsequence is favorable, the later consequences are\\ndisastrous, and vice versa. . . . Often, the sweeter the ﬁrst\\nfruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.”\\nPut another way , the costs of your good habits are in the\\npresent. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.\\nThe brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment\\nmeans you can’t rely on good intentions. When you make a\\nplan—to lose weight, write a book, or learn a language—\\nyou are actually making plans for your future self . And\\nwhen you envision what you want your life to be like, it is\\neasy to see the value in taking actions with long-term\\nbeneﬁts. W e all want better lives for our future selves.\\nHowever , when the moment of decision arrives, instant\\ngratiﬁcation usually wins. Y ou are no longer making a\\nchoice for Future Y ou, who dreams of being ﬁtter or\\nwealthier or happier . You are choosing for Present Y ou, who\\nwants to be full, pampered, and entertained. As a general\\nrule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action,\\nthe more strongly you should question whether it aligns\\nwith your long-term goals. *\\nWith a fuller understanding of what causes our brain to\\nrepeat some behaviors and avoid others, let’s update the\\nCardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately\\nrewarded is repeated. What is immediately  punished is\\navoided.\\nOur preference for instant gratiﬁcation reveals an\\nimportant truth about success: because of how we are\\nwired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of\\nsatisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed\\ngratiﬁcation. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll\\nface less competition and often get a bigger payoﬀ . As the\\nsaying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.\\nThis is precisely what research has shown. People who\\nare better at delaying gratiﬁcation have higher SA T scores,\\nlower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity ,\\nbetter responses to stress, and superior social skills. W e’ve\\nall seen this play out in our own lives. If you delay watching\\ntelevision and get your homework done, you’ll generally\\nlearn more and get better grades. If you don’t buy desserts\\nand chips at the store, you’ll often eat healthier food when\\nyou get home. A t some point, success in nearly every ﬁeld\\nrequires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a\\ndelayed reward.\\nHere’s the problem: most people know  that delaying\\ngratiﬁcation is the wise approach. They want the beneﬁts\\nof good habits: to be healthy , productive, at peace. But\\nthese outcomes are seldom top-of -mind at the decisive\\nmoment. Thankfully , it’s possible to train yourself to delay\\ngratiﬁcation—but you need to work with the grain of\\nhuman nature, not against it. The best way to do this is to\\nadd a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay\\noﬀ in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones\\nthat don’t.\\nHOW TO TURN INST ANT GRA TIFICA TION TO Y OUR\\nADVANTAGE\\nThe vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel\\nsuccessful—even if it’s in a small way . The feeling of\\nsuccess is a signal that your habit paid oﬀ and that the\\nwork was worth the eﬀort.\\nIn a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the\\nhabit itself . In the real world, good habits tend to feel\\nworthwhile only after they have provided you with\\nsomething. Early on, it’s all sacriﬁce. Y ou’ve gone to the\\ngym a few times, but you’re not stronger or ﬁtter or faster\\n—at least, not in any noticeable sense. It’s only months\\nlater, once you shed a few pounds or your arms gain some\\ndeﬁnition, that it becomes easier to exercise for its own\\nsake. In the beginning, you need a reason to stay on track.\\nThis is why immediate rewards are essential. They keep\\nyou excited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the\\nbackground.\\nWhat we’re really talking about here—when we’re\\ndiscussing immediate rewards—is the ending of a behavior .\\nThe ending of any experience is vital because we tend to\\nremember it more than other phases. Y ou want the ending\\nof your habit to be satisfying. The best approach is to use\\nreinforcement , which refers to the process of using an\\nimmediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior . Habit\\nstacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to\\nan immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start.\\nReinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward,\\nwhich makes it satisfying when you ﬁnish.\\nImmediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when\\ndealing with habits of avoidance , which are behaviors you\\nwant to stop doing. It can be challenging to stick with\\nhabits like “no frivolous purchases” or “no alcohol this\\nmonth” because nothing happens when you skip happy\\nhour drinks or don’t buy that pair of shoes. It can be hard\\nto feel satisﬁed when there is no action in the ﬁrst place.\\nAll you’re doing is resisting temptation, and there isn’t\\nmuch satisfying about that.\\nOne solution is to turn the situation on its head. Y ou want\\nto make avoidance visible. Open a savings account and\\nlabel it for something you want—maybe “Leather Jacket.”\\nWhenever you pass on a purchase, put the same amount of\\nmoney in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer\\n$5. P ass on another month of Netﬂix? Move $10 over . It’s\\nlike creating a loyalty program for yourself . The immediate\\nreward of seeing yourself save money toward the leather\\njacket feels a lot better than being deprived. Y ou are\\nmaking it satisfying to do nothing.\\nOne of my readers and his wife used a similar setup.\\nThey wanted to stop eating out so much and start cooking\\ntogether more. They labeled their savings account “Trip to\\nEurope.” Whenever they skipped going out to eat, they\\ntransferred $50 into the account. A t the end of the year ,\\nthey put the money toward the vacation.\\nIt is worth noting that it is important to select short-term\\nrewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that\\nconﬂict with it. Buying a new jacket is ﬁne if you’re trying\\nto lose weight or read more books, but it doesn’t work if\\nyou’re trying to budget and save money . Instead, taking a\\nbubble bath or going on a leisurely walk are good examples\\nof rewarding yourself with free time, which aligns with\\nyour ultimate goal of more freedom and ﬁnancial\\nindependence. Similarly , if your reward for exercising is\\neating a bowl of ice cream, then you’re casting votes for\\nconﬂicting identities, and it ends up being a wash. Instead,\\nmaybe your reward is a massage, which is both a luxury\\nand a vote toward taking care of your body . Now the short-\\nterm reward is aligned with your long-term vision of being\\na healthy person.\\nEventually , as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more\\nenergy , and reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less\\nconcerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity\\nitself becomes the reinforcer . You do it because it’s who you\\nare and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes\\npart of your life, the less you need outside encouragement\\nto follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity\\nsustains a habit.\\nThat said, it takes time for the evidence to accumulate\\nand a new identity to emerge. Immediate reinforcement\\nhelps maintain motivation in the short term while you’re\\nwaiting for the long-term rewards to arrive.\\nIn summary , a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last.\\nSimple bits of reinforcement—like soap that smells great or\\ntoothpaste that has a refreshing mint ﬂavor or seeing $50\\nhit your savings account—can oﬀer the immediate pleasure\\nyou need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is\\nenjoyable.\\nChapter Summary\\nThe 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying .\\nWe are more likely to repeat a behavior when the\\nexperience is satisfying.\\nThe human brain evolved to prioritize immediate\\nrewards over delayed rewards.\\nThe Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is\\nimmediately rewarded is repeated. What is\\nimmediately punished is avoided.\\nTo get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately\\nsuccessful—even if it’s in a small way .\\nThe ﬁrst three laws of behavior change— make it\\nobvious, make it attractive, and make it easy —increase\\nthe odds that a behavior will be performed this time.\\nThe fourth law of behavior change— make it satisfying\\n—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated\\nnext time.\\nI\\n16\\nHow to Stick with Good Habits Every Day\\nN 1993 , a bank in Abbotsford, Canada, hired a twenty-\\nthree-year-old stockbroker named Trent Dyrsmid.\\nAbbotsford was a relatively small suburb, tucked away in\\nthe shadow of nearby V ancouver , where most of the big\\nbusiness deals were being made. Given the location, and\\nthe fact that Dyrsmid was a rookie, nobody expected too\\nmuch of him. But he made brisk progress thanks to a\\nsimple daily habit.\\nDyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk.\\nOne was ﬁlled with 120 paper clips. The other was empty .\\nAs soon as he settled in each day , he would make a sales\\ncall. Immediately after , he would move one paper clip from\\nthe full jar to the empty jar and the process would begin\\nagain. “Every morning I would start with 120 paper clips in\\none jar and I would keep dialing the phone until I had\\nmoved them all to the second jar ,” he told me.\\nWithin eighteen months, Dyrsmid was bringing in $5\\nmillion to the ﬁrm. By age twenty-four , he was making\\n$75,000 per year—the equivalent of $125,000 today . Not\\nlong after , he landed a six -ﬁgure job with another company .\\nI like to refer to this technique as the P aper Clip Strategy\\nand, over the years, I’ve heard from readers who have\\nemployed it in a variety of ways. One woman shifted a\\nhairpin from one container to another whenever she wrote\\na page of her book. Another man moved a marble from one\\nbin to the next after each set of push-ups.\\nMaking progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like\\nmoving paper clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear\\nevidence of your progress. As a result, they reinforce your\\nbehavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to\\nany activity . Visual measurement comes in many forms:\\nfood journals, workout logs, loyalty punch cards, the\\nprogress bar on a software download, even the page\\nnumbers in a book. But perhaps the best way to measure\\nyour progress is with a habit tracker .\\nHOW TO KEEP Y OUR HABITS ON TRACK\\nA habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did\\na habit. The most basic format is to get a calendar and\\ncross oﬀ each day you stick with your routine. F or example,\\nif you meditate on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday , each of\\nthose dates gets an X. As time rolls by , the calendar\\nbecomes a record of your habit streak.\\nCountless people have tracked their habits, but perhaps\\nthe most famous was Benjamin Franklin. Beginning at age\\ntwenty , Franklin carried a small booklet everywhere he\\nwent and used it to track thirteen personal virtues. This list\\nincluded goals like “Lose no time. Be always employed in\\nsomething useful” and “ Avoid triﬂing conversation.” A t the\\nend of each day , Franklin would open his booklet and\\nrecord his progress.\\nJerry Seinfeld reportedly uses a habit tracker to stick\\nwith his streak of writing jokes. In the documentary\\nComedian , he explains that his goal is simply to “never\\nbreak the chain” of writing jokes every day . In other words,\\nhe is not focused on how good or bad a particular joke is or\\nhow inspired he feels. He is simply focused on showing up\\nand adding to his streak.\\n“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. Don’t\\nbreak the chain of sales calls and you’ll build a successful\\nbook of business. Don’t break the chain of workouts and\\nyou’ll get ﬁt faster than you’d expect. Don’t break the chain\\nof creating every day and you will end up with an\\nimpressive portfolio . Habit tracking is powerful because it\\nleverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It\\nsimultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and\\nsatisfying.\\nLet’s break down each one.\\nBeneﬁt #1: Habit tracking is obvious.\\nRecording your last action creates a trigger that can\\ninitiate your next one. Habit tracking naturally builds a\\nseries of visual cues like the streak of X’s on your calendar\\nor the list of meals in your food log. When you look at the\\ncalendar and see your streak, you’ll be reminded to act\\nagain. Research has shown that people who track their\\nprogress on goals like losing weight, quitting smoking, and\\nlowering blood pressure are all more likely to improve than\\nthose who don’t. One study of more than sixteen hundred\\npeople found that those who kept a daily food log lost twice\\nas much weight as those who did not. The mere act of\\ntracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it.\\nHabit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a\\ndistorted view of our own behavior . We think we act better\\nthan we do . Measurement oﬀers one way to overcome our\\nblindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really\\ngoing on each day . One glance at the paper clips in the\\ncontainer and you immediately know how much work you\\nhave (or haven’t) been putting in. When the evidence is\\nright in front of you, you’re less likely to lie to yourself .\\nBeneﬁt #2: Habit tracking is attractive.\\nThe most eﬀective form of motivation is progress. When we\\nget a signal that we are moving forward, we become more\\nmotivated to continue down that path. In this way , habit\\ntracking can have an addictive eﬀect on motivation. Each\\nsmall win feeds your desire.\\nThis can be particularly powerful on a bad day . When\\nyou’re feeling down, it’s easy to forget about all the\\nprogress you have already made. Habit tracking provides\\nvisual proof of your hard work—a subtle reminder of how\\nfar you’ve come. Plus, the empty square you see each\\nmorning can motivate you to get started because you don’t\\nwant to lose your progress by breaking the streak.\\nBeneﬁt #3: Habit tracking is satisf ying.\\nThis is the most crucial beneﬁt of all. Tracking can become\\nits own form of reward. It is satisfying to cross an item oﬀ\\nyour to-do list, to complete an entry in your workout log, or\\nto mark an X on the calendar . It feels good to watch your\\nresults grow—the size of your investment portfolio, the\\nlength of your book manuscript—and if it feels good, then\\nyou’re more likely to endure.\\nHabit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball:\\nyou’re focused on the process rather than the result. Y ou’re\\nnot ﬁxated on getting six -pack abs, you’re just trying to\\nkeep the streak alive and become the type of person who\\ndoesn’t miss workouts.\\nIn summary , habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that\\ncan remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because\\nyou see the progress you are making and don’t want to lose\\nit, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another\\nsuccessful instance of your habit. Furthermore, habit\\ntracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for\\nthe type of person you wish to become, which is a delightful\\nform of immediate and intrinsic gratiﬁcation. *\\nYou may be wondering, if habit tracking is so useful, why\\nhave I waited so long to talk about it?\\nDespite all the beneﬁts, I’ve left this discussion until now\\nfor a simple reason: many people resist the idea of tracking\\nand measuring. It can feel like a burden because it forces\\nyou into two habits: the habit you’re trying to build and the\\nhabit of tracking it. Counting calories sounds like a hassle\\nwhen you’re already struggling to follow a diet. W riting\\ndown every sales call seems tedious when you’ve got work\\nto do . It feels easier to say , “I’ll just eat less.” Or , “I’ll try\\nharder .” Or, “I’ll remember to do it.” P eople inevitably tell\\nme things like, “I have a decision journal, but I wish I used\\nit more.” Or , “I recorded my workouts for a week, but then\\nquit.” I’ve been there myself . I once made a food log to\\ntrack my calories. I managed to do it for one meal  and then\\ngave up.\\nTracking isn’t for everyone, and there is no need to\\nmeasure your entire life. But nearly anyone can beneﬁt\\nfrom it in some form—even if it’s only temporary .\\nWhat can we do to make tracking easier?\\nFirst, whenever possible, measurement should be\\nautomated. Y ou’ll probably be surprised by how much\\nyou’re already tracking without knowing it. Y our credit\\ncard statement tracks how often you go out to eat. Y our\\nFitbit registers how many steps you take and how long you\\nsleep. Y our calendar records how many new places you\\ntravel to each year . Once you know where to get the data,\\nadd a note to your calendar to review it each week or each\\nmonth, which is more practical than tracking it every day .\\nSecond, manual tracking should be limited to your most\\nimportant habits. It is better to consistently track one habit\\nthan to sporadically track ten.\\nFinally , record each measurement immediately after the\\nhabit occurs. The completion of the behavior is the cue to\\nwrite it down. This approach allows you to combine the\\nhabit-stacking method mentioned in Chapter 5 with habit\\ntracking.\\nThe habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:\\nAfter [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY\\nHABIT].\\nAfter I hang up the phone from a sales call, I will move\\none paper clip over .\\nAfter I ﬁnish each set at the gym, I will record it in my\\nworkout journal.\\nAfter I put my plate in the dishwasher , I will write\\ndown what I ate.\\nThese tactics can make tracking your habits easier . Even\\nif you aren’t the type of person who enjoys recording your\\nbehavior , I think you’ll ﬁnd a few weeks of measurements\\nto be insightful. It’s always interesting to see how you’ve\\nactually  been spending your time.\\nThat said, every habit streak ends at some point. And,\\nmore important than any single measurement, is having a\\ngood plan for when your habits slide oﬀ track.\\nHOW TO RECO VER QUICKL Y WHEN Y OUR HABITS\\nBREAK DOWN\\nNo matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is\\ninevitable that life will interrupt you at some point.\\nPerfection is not possible. Before long, an emergency will\\npop up—you get sick or you have to travel for work or your\\nfamily needs a little more of your time.\\nWhenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a\\nsimple rule: never miss twice.\\nIf I miss one day , I try to get back into it as quickly as\\npossible. Missing one workout happens, but I’m not going\\nto miss two in a row . Maybe I’ll eat an entire pizza, but I’ll\\nfollow it up with a healthy meal. I can’t be perfect, but I\\ncan avoid a second lapse. As soon as one streak ends, I get\\nstarted on the next one.\\nThe ﬁrst mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the\\nspiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an\\naccident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.\\nThis is a distinguishing feature between winners and\\nlosers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout,\\nor a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they\\nrebound quickly . The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if\\nthe reclaiming of it is fast.\\nI think this principle is so important that I’ll stick to it\\neven if I can’t do a habit as well or as completely as I would\\nlike. T oo often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our\\nhabits. The problem is not slipping up; the problem is\\nthinking that if you can’t do something perfectly , then you\\nshouldn’t do it at all.\\nYou don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on\\nyour bad (or busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than\\nsuccessful days help you. If you start with $100, then a 50\\npercent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33\\npercent loss to take you back to $100. In other words,\\navoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a\\n50 percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The ﬁrst rule of\\ncompounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily .”\\nThis is why the “bad” workouts are often the most\\nimportant ones. Sluggish days and bad workouts maintain\\nthe compound gains you accrued from previous good days.\\nSimply doing something—ten squats, ﬁve sprints, a push-\\nup, anything really—is huge. Don’t put up a zero . Don’t let\\nlosses eat into your compounding.\\nFurthermore, it’s not always about what happens during\\nthe workout. It’s about being the type of person who\\ndoesn’t miss workouts. It’s easy to train when you feel\\ngood, but it’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it\\n—even if you do less than you hope. Going to the gym for\\nﬁve minutes may not improve your performance, but it\\nreaﬀirms your identity .\\nThe all-or-nothing cycle of behavior change is just one\\npitfall that can derail your habits. Another potential danger\\n—especially if you are using a habit tracker—is measuring\\nthe wrong thing.\\nKNOWING WHEN (AND WHEN NOT) TO TRACK A HABIT\\nSay you’re running a restaurant and you want to know if\\nyour chef is doing a good job. One way to measure success\\nis to track how many customers pay for a meal each day . If\\nmore customers come in, the food must be good. If fewer\\ncustomers come in, something must be wrong.\\nHowever , this one measurement—daily revenue—only\\ngives a limited picture of what’s really going on. Just\\nbecause someone pays for a meal doesn’t mean they enjoy\\nthe meal. Even dissatisﬁed customers are unlikely to dine\\nand dash. In fact, if you’re only measuring revenue, the\\nfood might be getting worse but you’re making up for it\\nwith marketing or discounts or some other method.\\nInstead, it may be more eﬀective to track how many\\ncustomers ﬁnish  their meal or perhaps the percentage of\\ncustomers who leave a generous tip.\\nThe dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we\\nbecome driven by the number rather than the purpose\\nbehind it. If your success is measured by quarterly\\nearnings, you will optimize sales, revenue, and accounting\\nfor quarterly earnings. If your success is measured by a\\nlower number on the scale, you will optimize for a lower\\nnumber on the scale, even if that means embracing crash\\ndiets, juice cleanses, and fat-loss pills. The human mind\\nwants to “win” whatever game is being played.\\nThis pitfall is evident in many areas of life. W e focus on\\nworking long hours instead of getting meaningful work\\ndone. W e care more about getting ten thousand steps than\\nwe do about being healthy . We teach for standardized tests\\ninstead of emphasizing learning, curiosity , and critical\\nthinking. In short, we optimize for what we measure. When\\nwe choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong\\nbehavior .\\nThis is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law . Named\\nafter the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states,\\n“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good\\nmeasure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you\\nand adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes\\nyou. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the\\noverall system.\\nIn our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers\\nand undervalue anything ephemeral, soft, and diﬀicult to\\nquantify . We mistakenly think the factors we can measure\\nare the only factors that exist. But just because you can\\nmeasure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important\\nthing. And just because you can’t  measure something\\ndoesn’t mean it’s not important at all.\\nAll of this to say , it’s crucial to keep habit tracking in its\\nproper place. It can feel satisfying to record a habit and\\ntrack your progress, but the measurement is not the only\\nthing that matters. Furthermore, there are many ways to\\nmeasure progress, and sometimes it helps to shift your\\nfocus to something entirely diﬀerent.\\nThis is why nonscale victories  can be eﬀective for weight\\nloss. The number on the scale may be stubborn, so if you\\nfocus solely on that number , your motivation will sag. But\\nyou may notice that your skin looks better or you wake up\\nearlier or your sex drive got a boost. All of these are valid\\nways to track your improvement. If you’re not feeling\\nmotivated by the number on the scale, perhaps it’s time to\\nfocus on a diﬀerent measurement—one that gives you more\\nsignals of progress.\\nNo matter how you measure your improvement, habit\\ntracking oﬀers a simple way to make your habits more\\nsatisfying. Each measurement provides a little bit of\\nevidence that you’re moving in the right direction and a\\nbrief moment of immediate pleasure for a job well done.\\nChapter Summary\\nOne of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of\\nmaking progress.\\nA habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you\\ndid a habit—like marking an X on a calendar .\\nHabit trackers and other visual forms of measurement\\ncan make your habits satisfying by providing clear\\nevidence of your progress.\\nDon’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak\\nalive.\\nNever miss twice. If you miss one day , try to get back\\non track as quickly as possible.\\nJust because you can measure something doesn’t mean\\nit’s the most important thing.\\nA\\n17\\nHow an A ccountability P artner Can Change\\nEverything\\nFTER SER VING AS a pilot in W orld W ar II, Roger Fisher\\nattended Harvard Law School and spent thirty-four\\nyears specializing in negotiation and conﬂict management.\\nHe founded the Harvard Negotiation Project and worked\\nwith numerous countries and world leaders on peace\\nresolutions, hostage crises, and diplomatic compromises.\\nBut it was in the 1970s and 1980s, as the threat of nuclear\\nwar escalated, that Fisher developed perhaps his most\\ninteresting idea.\\nAt the time, Fisher was focused on designing strategies\\nthat could prevent nuclear war , and he had noticed a\\ntroubling fact. Any sitting president would have access to\\nlaunch codes that could kill millions of people but would\\nnever actually see anyone die because he would always be\\nthousands of miles away .\\n“My suggestion was quite simple,” he wrote in 1981.\\n“Put that [nuclear] code number in a little capsule, and\\nthen implant that capsule right next to the heart of a\\nvolunteer . The volunteer would carry with him a big, heavy\\nbutcher knife as he accompanied the President. If ever the\\nPresident wanted to ﬁre nuclear weapons, the only way he\\ncould do so would be for him ﬁrst, with his own hands, to\\nkill one human being. The President says, ‘George, I’m\\nsorry but tens of millions must die.’ He has to look at\\nsomeone and realize what death is—what an innocent\\ndeath is. Blood on the White House carpet. It’s reality\\nbrought home.\\n“When I suggested this to friends in the P entagon they\\nsaid, ‘My God, that’s terrible. Having to kill someone would\\ndistort the President’s judgment. He might never push the\\nbutton.’”\\nThroughout our discussion of the 4th Law of Behavior\\nChange we have covered the importance of making good\\nhabits immediately satisfying. Fisher’s proposal is an\\ninversion of the 4th Law: Make it immediately unsatisfying.\\nJust as we are more likely to repeat an experience when\\nthe ending is satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an\\nexperience when the ending is painful. P ain is an eﬀective\\nteacher . If a failure is painful, it gets ﬁxed. If a failure is\\nrelatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate\\nand more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from\\nit. The threat of a bad review forces a plumber to be good\\nat his job. The possibility of a customer never returning\\nmakes restaurants create good food. The cost of cutting the\\nwrong blood vessel makes a surgeon master human\\nanatomy and cut carefully . When the consequences are\\nsevere, people learn quickly .\\nThe more immediate the pain, the less likely the\\nbehavior . If you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate\\nunhealthy behaviors, then adding an instant cost to the\\naction is a great way to reduce their odds.\\nWe repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way ,\\nand that makes them hard to abandon. The best way I know\\nto overcome this predicament is to increase the speed of\\nthe punishment associated with the behavior . There can’t\\nbe a gap between the action and the consequences.\\nAs soon as actions incur an immediate consequence,\\nbehavior begins to change. Customers pay their bills on\\ntime when they are charged a late fee. Students show up to\\nclass when their grade is linked to attendance. W e’ll jump\\nthrough a lot of hoops to avoid a little bit of immediate\\npain.\\nThere is, of course, a limit to this. If you’re going to rely\\non punishment to change behavior , then the strength of the\\npunishment must match the relative strength of the\\nbehavior it is trying to correct. T o be productive, the cost of\\nprocrastination must be greater than the cost of action. T o\\nbe healthy , the cost of laziness must be greater than the\\ncost of exercise. Getting ﬁned for smoking in a restaurant\\nor failing to recycle adds consequence to an action.\\nBehavior only shifts if the punishment is painful enough\\nand reliably enforced.\\nIn general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and\\nimmediate the consequence, the more likely it is to\\ninﬂuence individual behavior . The more global, intangible,\\nvague, and delayed the consequence, the less likely it is to\\ninﬂuence individual behavior .\\nThankfully , there is a straightforward way to add an\\nimmediate cost to any bad habit: create a habit contract .\\nTHE HABIT CONTRACT\\nThe ﬁrst seat belt law was passed in New Y ork on\\nDecember 1, 1984. A t the time, just 14 percent of people in\\nthe United States regularly wore a seat belt—but that was\\nall about to change.\\nWithin ﬁve years, over half of the nation had seat belt\\nlaws. T oday, wearing a seat belt is enforceable by law in\\nforty-nine of the ﬁfty states. And it’s not just the legislation,\\nthe number of people wearing seat belts has changed\\ndramatically as well. In 2016, over 88 percent of Americans\\nbuckled up each time they got in a car . In just over thirty\\nyears, there was a complete reversal in the habits of\\nmillions of people.\\nLaws and regulations are an example of how government\\ncan change our habits by creating a social contract. As a\\nsociety , we collectively agree to abide by certain rules and\\nthen enforce them as a group. Whenever a new piece of\\nlegislation impacts behavior—seat belt laws, banning\\nsmoking inside restaurants, mandatory recycling—it is an\\nexample of a social contract shaping our habits. The group\\nagrees to act in a certain way , and if you don’t follow along,\\nyou’ll be punished.\\nJust as governments use laws to hold citizens\\naccountable, you can create a habit contract to hold\\nyourself accountable. A habit contract is a verbal or written\\nagreement in which you state your commitment to a\\nparticular habit and the punishment that will occur if you\\ndon’t follow through. Then you ﬁnd one or two people to\\nact as your accountability partners and sign oﬀ on the\\ncontract with you.\\nBryan Harris, an entrepreneur from Nashville,\\nTennessee, was the ﬁrst person I saw put this strategy into\\naction. Shortly after the birth of his son, Harris realized he\\nwanted to shed a few pounds. He wrote up a habit contract\\nbetween himself , his wife, and his personal trainer . The ﬁrst\\nversion read, “Bryan’s #1 objective for Q1 of 2017 is to\\nstart eating correctly again so he feels better , looks better ,\\nand is able to hit his long-term goal of 200 pounds at 10%\\nbody fat.”\\nBelow that statement, Harris laid out a road map for\\nachieving his ideal outcome:\\nPhase #1: Get back to a strict “slow-carb” diet in Q1.\\nPhase #2: Start a strict macronutrient tracking\\nprogram in Q2.\\nPhase #3: Reﬁne and maintain the details of his diet\\nand workout program in Q3.\\nFinally , he wrote out each of the daily habits that would\\nget him to his goal. F or example, “ Write down all food that\\nhe consumes each day and weigh himself each day .”\\nAnd then he listed the punishment if he failed: “If Bryan\\ndoesn’t do these two items then the following consequence\\nwill be enforced: He will have to dress up each workday\\nand each Sunday morning for the rest of the quarter . Dress\\nup is deﬁned as not wearing jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, or\\nshorts. He will also give Joey (his trainer) $200 to use as he\\nsees ﬁt if he misses one day of logging food.”\\nAt the bottom of the page, Harris, his wife, and his\\ntrainer all signed the contract.\\nMy initial reaction was that a contract like this seemed\\noverly formal and unnecessary , especially the signatures.\\nBut Harris convinced me that signing the contract was an\\nindication of seriousness. “ Anytime I skip this part,” he\\nsaid, “I start slacking almost immediately .”\\nThree months later , after hitting his targets for Q1,\\nHarris upgraded his goals. The consequences escalated,\\ntoo. If he missed his carbohydrate and protein targets, he\\nhad to pay his trainer $100. And if he failed to weigh\\nhimself , he had to give his wife $500 to use as she saw ﬁt.\\nPerhaps most painfully , if he forgot to run sprints, he had to\\ndress up for work every day and wear an Alabama hat the\\nrest of the quarter—the bitter rival of his beloved Auburn\\nteam.\\nThe strategy worked. W ith his wife and trainer acting as\\naccountability partners and with the habit contract\\nclarifying exactly what to do each day , Harris lost the\\nweight. *\\nTo make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to\\nmake them painful in the moment. Creating a habit\\ncontract is a straightforward way to do exactly that.\\nEven if you don’t want to create a full-blown habit\\ncontract, simply having an accountability partner is useful.\\nThe comedian Margaret Cho writes a joke or song every\\nday. She does the “song a day” challenge with a friend,\\nwhich helps them both stay accountable. Knowing that\\nsomeone is watching can be a powerful motivator . You are\\nless likely to procrastinate or give up because there is an\\nimmediate cost. If you don’t follow through, perhaps they’ll\\nsee you as untrustworthy or lazy . Suddenly , you are not only\\nfailing to uphold your promises to yourself , but also failing\\nto uphold your promises to others.\\nYou can even automate this process. Thomas Frank, an\\nentrepreneur in Boulder , Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each\\nmorning. And if he doesn’t, he has a tweet automatically\\nscheduled that says, “It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m\\nlazy! Reply to this for $5 via P ayPal (limit 5), assuming my\\nalarm didn’t malfunction.”\\nWe are always trying to present our best selves to the\\nworld. W e comb our hair and brush our teeth and dress\\nourselves carefully because we know these habits are likely\\nto get a positive reaction. W e want to get good grades and\\ngraduate from top schools to impress potential employers\\nand mates and our friends and family . We care about the\\nopinions of those around us because it helps if others like\\nus. This is precisely why getting an accountability partner\\nor signing a habit contract can work so well.\\nChapter Summary\\nThe inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is\\nmake it unsatisfying .\\nWe are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or\\nunsatisfying.\\nAn accountability partner can create an immediate cost\\nto inaction. W e care deeply about what others think of\\nus, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion\\nof us.\\nA habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any\\nbehavior . It makes the costs of violating your promises\\npublic and painful.\\nKnowing that someone else is watching you can be a\\npowerful motivator .\\nHOW TO CREA TE A GOOD HABIT\\nThe 1st Law: Mak e It Obvious\\n1.1: Fill out the Habits Scor ecard.

Phelps has won more Olympic medals not only than\\nany swimmer but also more than any Olympian in any\\nsport.\\nFewer people know the name Hicham El Guerrouj, but\\nhe was a fantastic athlete in his own right. El Guerrouj is a\\nMoroccan runner who holds two Olympic gold medals and\\nis one of the greatest middle-distance runners of all time.\\nFor many years, he held the world record in the mile,\\n1,500-meter , and 2,000-meter races. A t the Olympic Games\\nin Athens, Greece, in 2004, he won gold in the 1,500-meter\\nand 5,000-meter races.\\nThese two athletes are wildly diﬀerent in many ways.\\n(For starters, one competed on land and the other in\\nwater .) But most notably , they diﬀer signiﬁcantly in height.\\nEl Guerrouj is ﬁve feet, nine inches tall. Phelps is six feet,\\nfour inches tall. Despite this seven-inch diﬀerence in\\nheight, the two men are identical in one respect: Michael\\nPhelps and Hicham El Guerrouj wear the same length\\ninseam on their pants.\\nHow is this possible? Phelps has relatively short legs for\\nhis height and a very long torso, the perfect build for\\nswimming. El Guerrouj has incredibly long legs and a short\\nupper body , an ideal frame for distance running.\\nNow, imagine if these world-class athletes were to switch\\nsports. Given his remarkable athleticism, could Michael\\nPhelps become an Olympic-caliber distance runner with\\nenough training? It’s unlikely . At peak ﬁtness, Phelps\\nweighed 194 pounds, which is 40 percent heavier than El\\nGuerrouj, who competed at an ultralight 138 pounds. T aller\\nrunners are heavier runners, and every extra pound is a\\ncurse when it comes to distance running. Against elite\\ncompetition, Phelps would be doomed from the start.\\nSimilarly , El Guerrouj might be one of the best runners in\\nhistory , but it’s doubtful he would ever qualify for the\\nOlympics as a swimmer . Since 1976, the average height of\\nOlympic gold medalists in the men’s 1,500-meter run is ﬁve\\nfeet, ten inches. In comparison, the average height of\\nOlympic gold medalists in the men’s 100-meter freestyle\\nswim is six feet, four inches. Swimmers tend to be tall and\\nhave long backs and arms, which are ideal for pulling\\nthrough the water . El Guerrouj would be at a severe\\ndisadvantage before he ever touched the pool.\\nThe secret to maximizing your odds of success is to\\nchoose the right ﬁeld of competition. This is just as true\\nwith habit change as it is with sports and business. Habits\\nare easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with,\\nwhen they align with your natural inclinations and abilities.\\nLike Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on\\nthe track, you want to play a game where the odds are in\\nyour favor .\\nEmbracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the\\nsimple truth that people are born with diﬀerent abilities.\\nSome people don’t like to discuss this fact. On the surface,\\nyour genes seem to be ﬁxed, and it’s no fun to talk about\\nthings you cannot control. Plus, phrases like biological\\ndeterminism  makes it sound like certain individuals are\\ndestined for success and others doomed to failure. But this\\nis a shortsighted view of the inﬂuence of genes on behavior .\\nThe strength of genetics is also their weakness. Genes\\ncannot be easily changed, which means they provide a\\npowerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a\\nserious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. If you\\nwant to dunk a basketball, being seven feet tall is very\\nuseful. If you want to perform a gymnastics routine, being\\nseven feet tall is a great hindrance. Our environment\\ndetermines the suitability of our genes and the utility of our\\nnatural talents. When our environment changes, so do the\\nqualities that determine success.\\nThis is true not just for physical characteristics but for\\nmental ones as well. I’m smart if you ask me about habits\\nand human behavior; not so much when it comes to\\nknitting, rocket propulsion, or guitar chords. Competence\\nis highly dependent on context.\\nThe people at the top of any competitive ﬁeld are not\\nonly well trained, they are also well suited to the task. And\\nthis is why , if you want to be truly great, selecting the right\\nplace to focus is crucial.\\nIn short: genes do not determine your destiny . They\\ndetermine your areas of opportunity . As physician Gabor\\nMate notes, “ Genes can predispose, but they don’t\\npredetermine.” The areas where you are genetically\\npredisposed to success are the areas where habits are\\nmore likely to be satisfying. The key is to direct your eﬀort\\ntoward areas that both excite you and match your natural\\nskills, to align your ambition with your ability .\\nThe obvious question is, “How do I ﬁgure out where the\\nodds are in my favor? How do I identify the opportunities\\nand habits that are right for me?” The ﬁrst place we will\\nlook for an answer is by understanding your personality .\\nHOW Y OUR PERSONALITY INFL UENCES Y OUR HABITS\\nYour genes are operating beneath the surface of every\\nhabit. Indeed, beneath the surface of every behavior . Genes\\nhave been shown to inﬂuence everything from the number\\nof hours you spend watching television to your likelihood to\\nmarry or divorce to your tendency to get addicted to drugs,\\nalcohol, or nicotine. There’s a strong genetic component to\\nhow obedient or rebellious you are when facing authority ,\\nhow vulnerable or resistant you are to stressful events, how\\nproactive or reactive you tend to be, and even how\\ncaptivated or bored you feel during sensory experiences\\nlike attending a concert. As Robert Plomin, a behavioral\\ngeneticist at King’s College in London, told me, “It is now\\nat the point where we have stopped testing to see if traits\\nhave a genetic component because we literally can’t ﬁnd a\\nsingle one that isn’t inﬂuenced by our genes.”\\nBundled together , your unique cluster of genetic traits\\npredispose you to a particular personality . Your personality\\nis the set of characteristics that is consistent from situation\\nto situation. The most proven scientiﬁc analysis of\\npersonality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks\\nthem down into ﬁve spectrums of behavior .\\n1. Openness to experience: from curious and inventive\\non one end to cautious and consistent on the other .\\n2. Conscientiousness: organized and eﬀicient to\\neasygoing and spontaneous.\\n3. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and\\nreserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs.\\nintroverts).\\n4. Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to\\nchallenging and detached.\\n5. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to conﬁdent, calm,\\nand stable.\\nAll ﬁve characteristics have biological underpinnings.\\nExtroversion, for instance, can be tracked from birth. If\\nscientists play a loud noise in the nursing ward, some\\nbabies turn toward it while others turn away . When the\\nresearchers tracked these children through life, they found\\nthat the babies who turned toward the noise were more\\nlikely to grow up to be extroverts. Those who turned away\\nwere more likely to become introverts.\\nPeople who are high in agreeableness are kind,\\nconsiderate, and warm. They also tend to have higher\\nnatural oxytocin levels, a hormone that plays an important\\nrole in social bonding, increases feelings of trust, and can\\nact as a natural antidepressant. Y ou can easily imagine how\\nsomeone with more oxytocin might be inclined to build\\nhabits like writing thank -you notes or organizing social\\nevents.\\nAs a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a\\npersonality trait all people possess to various degrees.\\nPeople who are high in neuroticism tend to be anxious and\\nworry more than others. This trait has been linked to\\nhypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain\\nresponsible for noticing threats. In other words, people\\nwho are more sensitive to negative cues in their\\nenvironment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.\\nOur habits are not solely determined by our\\npersonalities, but there is no doubt that our genes nudge us\\nin a certain direction. Our deeply rooted preferences make\\ncertain behaviors easier for some people than for others.\\nYou don’t have to apologize for these diﬀerences or feel\\nguilty about them, but you do have to work with them. A\\nperson who scores lower on conscientiousness, for\\nexample, will be less likely to be orderly by nature and may\\nneed to rely more heavily on environment design to stick\\nwith good habits. (As a reminder for the less conscientious\\nreaders among us, environment design is a strategy we\\ndiscussed in Chapters 6 and 12.)\\nThe takeaway is that you should build habits that work\\nfor your personality .* People can get ripped working out\\nlike a bodybuilder , but if you prefer rock climbing or\\ncycling or rowing, then shape your exercise habit around\\nyour interests. If your friend follows a low-carb diet but you\\nﬁnd that low-fat works for you, then more power to you. If\\nyou want to read more, don’t be embarrassed if you prefer\\nsteamy romance novels over nonﬁction. Read whatever\\nfascinates you. * You don’t have to build the habits everyone\\ntells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not\\nthe one that is most popular .\\nThere is a version of every habit that can bring you joy\\nand satisfaction. Find it. Habits need to be enjoyable if they\\nare going to stick. This is the core idea behind the 4th Law .\\nTailoring your habits to your personality is a good start,\\nbut this is not the end of the story . Let’s turn our attention\\nto ﬁnding and designing situations where you’re at a\\nnatural advantage.\\nHOW TO FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN\\nYOUR F AVOR\\nLearning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is\\ncritical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful.\\nIn theory , you can enjoy almost anything. In practice, you\\nare more likely to enjoy the things that come easily to you.\\nPeople who are talented in a particular area tend to be\\nmore competent at that task and are then praised for doing\\na good job. They stay energized because they are making\\nprogress where others have failed, and because they get\\nrewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities, which\\nnot only makes them happier but also propels them to\\nproduce even higher-quality work. It’s a virtuous cycle.\\nPick the right habit and progress is easy . Pick the wrong\\nhabit and life is a struggle.\\nHow do you pick the right habit? The ﬁrst step is\\nsomething we covered in the 3rd Law: make it easy . In\\nmany cases, when people pick the wrong habit, it simply\\nmeans they picked a habit that was too diﬀicult. When a\\nhabit is easy , you are more likely to be successful. When\\nyou are successful, you are more likely to feel satisﬁed.\\nHowever , there is another level to consider . In the long-run,\\nif you continue to advance and improve, any area can\\nbecome challenging. A t some point, you need to make sure\\nyou’re playing the right game for your skillset. How do you\\nﬁgure that out?\\nThe most common approach is trial and error . Of course,\\nthere’s a problem with this strategy: life is short. Y ou don’t\\nhave time to try every career , date every eligible bachelor ,\\nor play every musical instrument. Thankfully , there is an\\neﬀective way to manage this conundrum, and it is known as\\nthe explore/exploit trade-oﬀ .\\nIn the beginning of a new activity , there should be a\\nperiod of exploration. In relationships, it’s called dating. In\\ncollege, it’s called the liberal arts. In business, it’s called\\nsplit testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities,\\nresearch a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.\\nAfter this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to\\nthe best solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting\\noccasionally . The proper balance depends on whether\\nyou’re winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you\\nexploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you\\ncontinue to explore, explore, explore.\\nIn the long-run it is probably most eﬀective to work on\\nthe strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80\\nto 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the\\nremaining 10 to 20 percent. Google famously asks\\nemployees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on their\\noﬀicial job and 20 percent on projects of their choice,\\nwhich has led to the creation of blockbuster products like\\nAdWords and Gmail.\\nThe optimal approach also depends on how much time\\nyou have. If you have a lot of time—like someone at the\\nbeginning of their career—it makes more sense to explore\\nbecause once you ﬁnd the right thing, you still have a good\\namount of time to exploit it. If you’re pressed for time—say ,\\nas you come up on the deadline for a project—you should\\nimplement the best solution you’ve found so far and get\\nsome results.\\nAs you explore diﬀerent options, there are a series of\\nquestions you can ask yourself to continually narrow in on\\nthe habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you:\\nWhat feels like fun to me, but work to others? The\\nmark of whether you are made for a task is not\\nwhether you love it but whether you can handle the\\npain of the task easier than most people. When are you\\nenjoying yourself while other people are complaining?\\nThe work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the\\nwork you were made to do .\\nWhat makes me lose track of time? Flow is the\\nmental state you enter when you are so focused on the\\ntask at hand that the rest of the world fades away . This\\nblend of happiness and peak performance is what\\nathletes and performers experience when they are “in\\nthe zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a ﬂow\\nstate and not ﬁnd the task satisfying at least to some\\ndegree.\\nWhere do I get greater returns than the average\\nperson?  We are continually comparing ourselves to\\nthose around us, and a behavior is more likely to be\\nsatisfying when the comparison is in our favor . When I\\nstarted writing at jamesclear .com, my email list grew\\nvery quickly . I wasn’t quite sure what I was doing well,\\nbut I knew that results seemed to be coming faster for\\nme than for some of my colleagues, which motivated\\nme to keep writing.\\nWhat comes naturally to me? For just a moment,\\nignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society\\nhas told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look\\ninside yourself and ask, “ What feels natural to me?\\nWhen have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real\\nme?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No\\nsecond-guessing or self -criticism. Just feelings of\\nengagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel\\nauthentic and genuine, you are headed in the right\\ndirection.\\nTo be honest, some of this process is just luck. Michael\\nPhelps and Hicham El Guerrouj were lucky to be born with\\na rare set of abilities that are highly valued by society and\\nto be placed in the ideal environment for those abilities. W e\\nall have limited time on this planet, and the truly great\\namong us are the ones who not only work hard but also\\nhave the good fortune to be exposed to opportunities that\\nfavor us.\\nBut what if you don’t want to leave it up to luck?\\nIf you can’t ﬁnd a game where the odds are stacked in\\nyour favor , create one. Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind\\nDilbert , says, “ Everyone has at least a few areas in which\\nthey could be in the top 25% with some eﬀort. In my case, I\\ncan draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist.\\nAnd I’m not any funnier than the average standup\\ncomedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than\\nmost people. The magic is that few people can draw well\\nand write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes\\nwhat I do so rare. And when you add in my business\\nbackground, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists\\ncould hope to understand without living it.”\\nWhen you can’t win by being better , you can win by\\nbeing diﬀerent. By combining your skills, you reduce the\\nlevel of competition, which makes it easier to stand out.\\nYou can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for\\nyears of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player\\nworks hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A\\ngreat player creates a new game that favors their strengths\\nand avoids their weaknesses.\\nIn college, I designed my own major , biomechanics,\\nwhich was a combination of physics, chemistry , biology , and\\nanatomy . I wasn’t smart enough to stand out among the top\\nphysics or biology majors, so I created my own game. And\\nbecause it suited me—I was only taking the courses I was\\ninterested in—studying felt like less of a chore. It was also\\neasier to avoid the trap of comparing myself to everyone\\nelse. A fter all, nobody else was taking the same\\ncombination of classes, so who could say if they were better\\nor worse?\\nSpecialization is a powerful way to overcome the\\n“accident” of bad genetics. The more you master a speciﬁc\\nskill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you.\\nMany bodybuilders are stronger than the average arm\\nwrestler , but even a massive bodybuilder may lose at arm\\nwrestling because the arm wrestling champ has very\\nspeciﬁc strength. Even if you’re not the most naturally\\ngifted, you can often win by being the best in a very narrow\\ncategory .\\nBoiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. Y ou\\ncan’t control whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you\\ncan decide to play a game where it’s better to be hard or\\nsoft. If you can ﬁnd a more favorable environment, you can\\ntransform the situation from one where the odds are\\nagainst you to one where they are in your favor .\\nHOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF Y OUR GENES\\nOur genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They\\nclarify it. They tell us what  to work hard on. Once we\\nrealize our strengths, we know where to spend our time\\nand energy . We know which types of opportunities to look\\nfor and which types of challenges to avoid. The better we\\nunderstand our nature, the better our strategy can be.\\nBiological diﬀerences matter . Even so, it’s more\\nproductive to focus on whether you are fulﬁlling your own\\npotential than comparing yourself to someone else. The fact\\nthat you have a natural limit to any speciﬁc ability has\\nnothing to do with whether you are reaching the ceiling of\\nyour capabilities. P eople get so caught up in the fact that\\nthey have  limits that they rarely exert the eﬀort required to\\nget close to them.\\nFurthermore, genes can’t make you successful if you’re\\nnot doing the work. Y es, it’s possible that the ripped trainer\\nat the gym has better genes, but if you haven’t put in the\\nsame reps, it’s impossible to say if you have been dealt a\\nbetter or worse genetic hand. Until you work as hard as\\nthose you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.\\nIn summary , one of the best ways to ensure your habits\\nremain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that\\nalign with your personality and skills. W ork hard on the\\nthings that come easy .\\nChapter Summary\\nThe secret to maximizing your odds of success is to\\nchoose the right ﬁeld of competition.\\nPick the right habit and progress is easy .

Labor laws were loose back then and the boy\\nmanaged to land a position selling guidebooks for $0.50\\napiece.\\nWithin a year , he had transitioned to Disney’s magic\\nshop, where he learned tricks from the older employees. He\\nexperimented with jokes and tried out simple routines on\\nvisitors. Soon he discovered that what he loved was not\\nperforming magic but performing in general. He set his\\nsights on becoming a comedian.\\nBeginning in his teenage years, he started performing in\\nlittle clubs around Los Angeles. The crowds were small and\\nhis act was short. He was rarely on stage for more than ﬁve\\nminutes. Most of the people in the crowd were too busy\\ndrinking or talking with friends to pay attention. One night,\\nhe literally delivered his stand-up routine to an empty club.\\nIt wasn’t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was\\ngetting better . His ﬁrst routines would only last one or two\\nminutes. By high school, his material had expanded to\\ninclude a ﬁve-minute act and, a few years later , a ten-\\nminute show . At nineteen, he was performing weekly for\\ntwenty minutes at a time. He had to read three poems\\nduring the show just to make the routine long enough, but\\nhis skills continued to progress.\\nHe spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and\\npracticing. He took a job as a television writer and,\\ngradually , he was able to land his own appearances on talk\\nshows. By the mid-1970s, he had worked his way into being\\na regular guest on The T onight Show  and Saturday Night\\nLive.\\nFinally , after nearly ﬁfteen years of work, the young man\\nrose to fame. He toured sixty cities in sixty-three days.\\nThen seventy-two cities in eighty days. Then eighty-ﬁve\\ncities in ninety days. He had 18,695 people attend one\\nshow in Ohio . Another 45,000 tickets were sold for his\\nthree-day show in New Y ork. He catapulted to the top of his\\ngenre and became one of the most successful comedians of\\nhis time.\\nHis name is Steve Martin.\\nMartin’s story oﬀers a fascinating perspective on what it\\ntakes to stick with habits for the long run. Comedy is not\\nfor the timid. It is hard to imagine a situation that would\\nstrike fear into the hearts of more people than performing\\nalone on stage and failing to get a single laugh. And yet\\nSteve Martin faced this fear every week for eighteen years.\\nIn his words, “10 years spent learning, 4 years spent\\nreﬁning, and 4 years as a wild success.”\\nWhy is it that some people, like Martin, stick with their\\nhabits—whether practicing jokes or drawing cartoons or\\nplaying guitar—while most of us struggle to stay\\nmotivated? How do we design habits that pull us in rather\\nthan ones that fade away? Scientists have been studying\\nthis question for many years. While there is still much to\\nlearn, one of the most consistent ﬁndings is that the way to\\nmaintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to\\nwork on tasks of “ just manageable diﬀiculty .”\\nThe human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within\\nan optimal zone of diﬀiculty . If you love tennis and try to\\nplay a serious match against a four-year-old, you will\\nquickly become bored. It’s too easy . You’ll win every point.\\nIn contrast, if you play a professional tennis player like\\nRoger F ederer or Serena W illiams, you will quickly lose\\nmotivation because the match is too diﬀicult.\\nNow consider playing tennis against someone who is\\nyour equal. As the game progresses, you win a few points\\nand you lose a few . You have a good chance of winning, but\\nonly if you really try . Your focus narrows, distractions fade\\naway , and you ﬁnd yourself fully invested in the task at\\nhand. This is a challenge of just manageable diﬀiculty and\\nit is a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule .\\nThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak\\nmotivation when working on tasks that are right on the\\nedge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy .\\nJust right.\\nTHE GOLDIL OCKS RULE\\nFIGURE 15: Maximum motivation occurs when facing a challenge\\nof just manageable diﬃculty . In psychology r esear ch this is\\nknown as the Y erkes–Dodson law, which describes the optimal\\nlevel of ar ousal as the midpoint between bor edom and anxiety .\\nMartin’s comedy career is an excellent example of the\\nGoldilocks Rule in practice. Each year , he expanded his\\ncomedy routine—but only by a minute or two . He was\\nalways adding new material, but he also kept a few jokes\\nthat were guaranteed to get laughs. There were just\\nenough victories to keep him motivated and just enough\\nmistakes to keep him working hard.\\nWhen you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep\\nthe behavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it\\neven when conditions aren’t perfect. This is an idea we\\ncovered in detail while discussing the 3rd Law of Behavior\\nChange.\\nOnce a habit has been established, however , it’s\\nimportant to continue to advance in small ways. These little\\nimprovements and new challenges keep you engaged. And\\nif you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve a\\nﬂow state .*\\nA ﬂow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and\\nfully immersed in an activity . Scientists have tried to\\nquantify this feeling. They found that to achieve a state of\\nﬂow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current\\nability . In real life it’s typically not feasible to quantify the\\ndiﬀiculty of an action in this way , but the core idea of the\\nGoldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just\\nmanageable diﬀiculty—something on the perimeter of your\\nability—seems crucial for maintaining motivation.\\nImprovement requires a delicate balance. Y ou need to\\nregularly search for challenges that push you to your edge\\nwhile continuing to make enough progress to stay\\nmotivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for\\nthem to stay attractive and satisfying. W ithout variety , we\\nget bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on\\nthe quest for self -improvement.\\nHOW TO ST AY FOCUSED WHEN Y OU GET BORED\\nWORKING ON Y OUR GO ALS\\nAfter my baseball career ended, I was looking for a new\\nsport. I joined a weightlifting team and one day an elite\\ncoach visited our gym. He had worked with thousands of\\nathletes during his long career , including a few Olympians.\\nI introduced myself and we began talking about the process\\nof improvement.\\n“What’s the diﬀerence between the best athletes and\\neveryone else?” I asked. “ What do the really successful\\npeople do that most don’t?”\\nHe mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics,\\nluck, talent. But then he said something I wasn’t expecting:\\n“At some point it comes down to who can handle the\\nboredom of training every day , doing the same lifts over\\nand over and over .”\\nHis answer surprised me because it’s a diﬀerent way of\\nthinking about work ethic. P eople talk about getting\\n“amped up” to work on their goals. Whether it’s business or\\nsports or art, you hear people say things like, “It all comes\\ndown to passion.” Or , “You have to really want it.” As a\\nresult, many of us get depressed when we lose focus or\\nmotivation because we think that successful people have\\nsome bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was\\nsaying that really successful people feel the same lack of\\nmotivation as everyone else. The diﬀerence is that they still\\nﬁnd a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.\\nMastery requires practice. But the more you practice\\nsomething, the more boring and routine it becomes. Once\\nthe beginner gains have been made and we learn what to\\nexpect, our interest starts to fade. Sometimes it happens\\neven faster than that. All you have to do is hit the gym a\\nfew days in a row or publish a couple of blog posts on time\\nand letting one day slip doesn’t feel like much. Things are\\ngoing well. It’s easy to rationalize taking a day oﬀ because\\nyou’re in a good place.\\nThe greatest threat to success is not failure but\\nboredom. W e get bored with habits because they stop\\ndelighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as our\\nhabits become ordinary , we start derailing our progress to\\nseek novelty . Perhaps this is why we get caught up in a\\nnever-ending cycle, jumping from one workout to the next,\\none diet to the next, one business idea to the next. As soon\\nas we experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin\\nseeking a new strategy—even if the old one was still\\nworking. As Machiavelli noted, “ Men desire novelty to such\\nan extent that those who are doing well wish for a change\\nas much as those who are doing badly .”\\nPerhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming\\nproducts are those that provide continuous forms of\\nnovelty . Video games provide visual novelty . Porn provides\\nsexual novelty . Junk foods provide culinary novelty . Each of\\nthese experiences oﬀer continual elements of surprise.\\nIn psychology , this is known as a variable reward .* Slot\\nmachines are the most common real-world example. A\\ngambler hits the jackpot every now and then but not at any\\npredictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This\\nvariance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances\\nmemory recall, and accelerates habit formation.\\nVariable rewards won’t create  a craving—that is, you\\ncan’t take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to\\nthem at a variable interval, and hope it will change their\\nmind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings\\nwe already experience because they reduce boredom.\\nThe sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between\\nsuccess and failure. Half of the time you get what you want.\\nHalf of the time you don’t. Y ou need just enough “winning”\\nto experience satisfaction and just enough “wanting” to\\nexperience desire. This is one of the beneﬁts of following\\nthe Goldilocks Rule. If you’re already interested in a habit,\\nworking on challenges of just manageable diﬀiculty is a\\ngood way to keep things interesting.\\nOf course, not all habits have a variable reward\\ncomponent, and you wouldn’t want them to . If Google only\\ndelivered a useful search result some of the time, I would\\nswitch to a competitor pretty quickly . If Uber only picked\\nup half of my trips, I doubt I’d be using that service much\\nlonger . And if I ﬂossed my teeth each night and only\\nsometimes ended up with a clean mouth, I think I’d skip it.\\nVariable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting\\nforever . At some point, everyone faces the same challenge\\non the journey of self -improvement: you have to fall in love\\nwith boredom.\\nWe all have goals that we would like to achieve and\\ndreams that we would like to fulﬁll, but it doesn’t matter\\nwhat you are trying to become better at, if you only do the\\nwork when it’s convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be\\nconsistent enough to achieve remarkable results.\\nI can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and\\nkeep sticking to it, there will be days when you feel like\\nquitting. When you start a business, there will be days\\nwhen you don’t feel like showing up. When you’re at the\\ngym, there will be sets that you don’t feel like ﬁnishing.\\nWhen it’s time to write, there will be days that you don’t\\nfeel like typing. But stepping up when it’s annoying or\\npainful or draining to do so, that’s what makes the\\ndiﬀerence between a professional and an amateur .\\nProfessionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get\\nin the way . Professionals know what is important to them\\nand work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled oﬀ\\ncourse by the urgencies of life.\\nDavid Cain, an author and meditation teacher ,\\nencourages his students to avoid being “fair-weather\\nmeditators.” Similarly , you don’t want to be a fair-weather\\nathlete or a fair-weather writer or a fair-weather anything.\\nWhen a habit is truly important to you, you have to be\\nwilling to stick to it in any mood. Professionals take action\\neven when the mood isn’t right. They might not enjoy it,\\nbut they ﬁnd a way to put the reps in.\\nThere have been a lot of sets that I haven’t felt like\\nﬁnishing, but I’ve never regretted doing the workout. There\\nhave been a lot of articles I haven’t felt like writing, but\\nI’ve never regretted publishing on schedule. There have\\nbeen a lot of days I’ve felt like relaxing, but I’ve never\\nregretted showing up and working on something that was\\nimportant to me.\\nThe only way to become excellent is to be endlessly\\nfascinated by doing the same thing over and over . You have\\nto fall in love with boredom.\\nChapter Summary\\nThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience\\npeak motivation when working on tasks that are right\\non the edge of their current abilities.\\nThe greatest threat to success is not failure but\\nboredom.\\nAs habits become routine, they become less interesting\\nand less satisfying. W e get bored.\\nAnyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s\\nthe ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that\\nmakes the diﬀerence.\\nProfessionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life\\nget in the way.\\nH\\n20\\nThe Downside of Cr eating Good Habits\\nABITS CREA TE THE FOUNDA TION FOR MASTER Y. In chess, it is\\nonly after the basic movements of the pieces have\\nbecome automatic that a player can focus on the next level\\nof the game. Each chunk of information that is memorized\\nopens up the mental space for more eﬀortful thinking. This\\nis true for any endeavor . When you know the simple\\nmovements so well that you can perform them without\\nthinking, you are free to pay attention to more advanced\\ndetails. In this way , habits are the backbone of any pursuit\\nof excellence.\\nHowever , the beneﬁts of habits come at a cost. A t ﬁrst,\\neach repetition develops ﬂuency , speed, and skill. But then,\\nas a habit becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to\\nfeedback. Y ou fall into mindless repetition. It becomes\\neasier to let mistakes slide. When you can do it “good\\nenough” on autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it\\nbetter .\\nThe upside of habits is that we can do things without\\nthinking. The downside of habits is that you get used to\\ndoing things a certain way and stop paying attention to\\nlittle errors. Y ou assume you’re getting better because\\nyou’re gaining experience. In reality , you are merely\\nreinforcing your current habits—not improving them. In\\nfact, some research has shown that once a skill has been\\nmastered there is usually a slight decline  in performance\\nover time.\\nUsually , this minor dip in performance is no cause for\\nworry . You don’t need a system to continuously improve\\nhow well you brush your teeth or tie your shoes or make\\nyour morning cup of tea. W ith habits like these, good\\nenough is usually good enough. The less energy you spend\\non trivial choices, the more you can spend it on what really\\nmatters.\\nHowever , when you want to maximize your potential and\\nachieve elite levels of performance, you need a more\\nnuanced approach. Y ou can’t repeat the same things blindly\\nand expect to become exceptional. Habits are necessary ,\\nbut not suﬀicient for mastery . What you need is a\\ncombination of automatic habits and deliberate practice.\\nHabits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery\\nTo become great, certain skills do need to become\\nautomatic. Basketball players need to be able to dribble\\nwithout thinking before they can move on to mastering\\nlayups with their nondominant hand. Surgeons need to\\nrepeat the ﬁrst incision so many times that they could do it\\nwith their eyes closed, so that they can focus on the\\nhundreds of variables that arise during surgery . But after\\none habit has been mastered, you have to return to the\\neﬀortful part of the work and begin building the next habit.\\nMastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny\\nelement of success, repeating it until you have internalized\\nthe skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to\\nadvance to the next frontier of your development. Old tasks\\nbecome easier the second time around, but it doesn’t get\\neasier overall because now you’re pouring your energy into\\nthe next challenge. Each habit unlocks the next level of\\nperformance. It’s an endless cycle.\\nMASTERING ONE HABIT\\nMASTERING A FIELD\\nFIGURE 16: The pr ocess of mastery r equir es that you\\nprogressively layer impr ovements on top of one another, each\\nhabit building upon the last until a new level of perfor mance has\\nbeen r eached and a higher range of skills has been inter nalized.\\nAlthough habits are powerful, what you need is a way to\\nremain conscious of your performance over time, so you\\ncan continue to reﬁne and improve. It is precisely at the\\nmoment when you begin to feel like you have mastered a\\nskill—right when things are starting to feel automatic and\\nyou are becoming comfortable—that you must avoid\\nslipping into the trap of complacency .\\nThe solution? Establish a system for reﬂection and\\nreview .\\nHOW TO REVIEW Y OUR HABITS AND MAKE\\nADJUSTMENTS\\nIn 1986, the Los Angeles Lakers had one of the most\\ntalented basketball teams ever assembled, but they are\\nrarely remembered that way . The team started the 1985–\\n1986 NBA season with an astounding 29–5 record. “ The\\npundits were saying that we might be the best team in the\\nhistory of basketball,” head coach P at Riley said after the\\nseason. Surprisingly , the Lakers stumbled in the 1986\\nplayoﬀs and suﬀered a season-ending defeat in the W estern\\nConference Finals. The “best team in the history of\\nbasketball” didn’t even play for the NBA championship.\\nAfter that blow , Riley was tired of hearing about how\\nmuch talent his players had and about how much promise\\nhis team held. He didn’t want to see ﬂashes of brilliance\\nfollowed by a gradual fade in performance. He wanted the\\nLakers to play up to their potential, night after night. In the\\nsummer of 1986, he created a plan to do exactly that, a\\nsystem that he called the Career Best Eﬀort program or\\nCBE.\\n“When players ﬁrst join the Lakers,” Riley explained, “we\\ntrack their basketball statistics all the way back to high\\nschool. I call this T aking Their Number . We look for an\\naccurate gauge of what a player can do, then build him into\\nour plan for the team, based on the notion that he will\\nmaintain and then improve upon his averages.”\\nAfter determining a player’s baseline level of\\nperformance, Riley added a key step. He asked each player\\nto “improve their output by at least 1 percent over the\\ncourse of the season. If they succeeded, it would be a CBE,\\nor Career Best Eﬀort.” Similar to the British Cycling team\\nthat we discussed in Chapter 1, the Lakers sought peak\\nperformance by getting slightly better each day .\\nRiley was careful to point out that CBE was not merely\\nabout points or statistics but about giving your “best eﬀort\\nspiritually and mentally and physically .” Players got credit\\nfor “allowing an opponent to run into you when you know\\nthat a foul will be called against him, diving for loose balls,\\ngoing after rebounds whether you are likely to get them or\\nnot, helping a teammate when the player he’s guarding has\\nsurged past him, and other ‘unsung hero’ deeds.”\\nAs an example, let’s say that Magic Johnson—the Lakers\\nstar player at the time—had 11 points, 8 rebounds, 12\\nassists, 2 steals, and 5 turnovers in a game. Magic also got\\ncredit for an “unsung hero” deed by diving after a loose\\nball (+1). Finally , he played a total of 33 minutes in this\\nimaginary game.\\nThe positive numbers (11 + 8 + 12 + 2 + 1) add up to\\n34. Then, we subtract the 5 turnovers (34–5) to get 29.\\nFinally , we divide 29 by 33 minutes played.\\n29/33 = 0.879\\nMagic’s CBE number here would be 879. This number\\nwas calculated for all of a player’s games, and it was the\\naverage CBE that a player was asked to improve by 1\\npercent over the season. Riley compared each player’s\\ncurrent CBE to not only their past performances but also\\nthose of other players in the league. As Riley put it, “ We\\nrank team members alongside league opponents who play\\nthe same position and have similar role deﬁnitions.”\\nSportswriter Jackie MacMullan noted, “Riley trumpeted\\nthe top performers in the league in bold lettering on the\\nblackboard each week and measured them against the\\ncorresponding players on his own roster . Solid, reliable\\nplayers generally rated a score in the 600s, while elite\\nplayers scored at least 800. Magic Johnson, who submitted\\n138 triple-doubles in his career , often scored over 1,000.”\\nThe Lakers also emphasized year-over-year progress by\\nmaking historical comparisons of CBE data. Riley said, “ We\\nstacked the month of November 1986, next to November\\n1985, and showed the players whether they were doing\\nbetter or worse than at the same point last season. Then we\\nshowed them how their performance ﬁgures for December\\n1986, stacked up against November’s.”\\nThe Lakers rolled out CBE in October 1986. Eight\\nmonths later , they were NBA champions. The following\\nyear, Pat Riley led his team to another title as the Lakers\\nbecame the ﬁrst team in twenty years to win back -to-back\\nNBA championships. A fterward, he said, “ Sustaining an\\neﬀort is the most important thing for any enterprise. The\\nway to be successful is to learn how to do things right, then\\ndo them the same way every time.”\\nThe CBE program is a prime example of the power of\\nreﬂection and review . The Lakers were already talented.\\nCBE helped them get the most out of what they had, and\\nmade sure their habits improved rather than declined.\\nReﬂection and review enables the long-term\\nimprovement of all habits because it makes you aware of\\nyour mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for\\nimprovement. W ithout reﬂection, we can make excuses,\\ncreate rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. W e have no\\nprocess for determining whether we are performing better\\nor worse compared to yesterday .\\nTop performers in all ﬁelds engage in various types of\\nreﬂection and review , and the process doesn’t have to be\\ncomplex. K enyan runner Eliud Kipchoge is one of the\\ngreatest marathoners of all time and an Olympic gold\\nmedalist. He still takes notes after every practice in which\\nhe reviews his training for the day and searches for areas\\nthat can be improved. Similarly , gold medal swimmer Katie\\nLedecky records her wellness on a scale of 1 to 10 and\\nincludes notes on her nutrition and how well she slept. She\\nalso records the times posted by other swimmers. A t the\\nend of each week, her coach goes over her notes and adds\\nhis thoughts.\\nIt’s not just athletes, either . When comedian Chris Rock\\nis preparing fresh material, he will ﬁrst appear at small\\nnightclubs dozens of times and test hundreds of jokes. He\\nbrings a notepad on stage and records which bits go over\\nwell and where he needs to make adjustments. The few\\nkiller lines that survive will form the backbone of his new\\nshow .\\nI know of executives and investors who keep a “decision\\njournal” in which they record the major decisions they\\nmake each week, why they made them, and what they\\nexpect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the\\nend of each month or year to see where they were correct\\nand where they went wrong. *\\nImprovement is not just about learning habits, it’s also\\nabout ﬁne-tuning them. Reﬂection and review ensures that\\nyou spend your time on the right things and make course\\ncorrections whenever necessary—like P at Riley adjusting\\nthe eﬀort of his players on a nightly basis. Y ou don’t want\\nto keep practicing a habit if it becomes ineﬀective.\\nPersonally , I employ two primary modes of reﬂection and\\nreview . Each December , I perform an Annual Review , in\\nwhich I reﬂect on the previous year . I tally my habits for the\\nyear by counting up how many articles I published, how\\nmany workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and\\nmore. * Then, I reﬂect on my progress (or lack thereof) by\\nanswering three questions:\\n1. What went well this year?\\n2. What didn’t go so well this year?\\n3. What did I learn?\\nSix months later , when summer rolls around, I conduct\\nan Integrity Report . Like everyone, I make a lot of\\nmistakes. My Integrity Report helps me realize where I\\nwent wrong and motivates me to get back on course. I use\\nit as a time to revisit my core values and consider whether I\\nhave been living in accordance with them. This is when I\\nreﬂect on my identity and how I can work toward being the\\ntype of person I wish to become. *\\nMy yearly Integrity Report answers three questions:\\n1. What are the core values that drive my life and work?\\n2. How am I living and working with integrity right now?\\n3. How can I set a higher standard in the future?\\nThese two reports don’t take very long—just a few hours\\nper year—but they are crucial periods of reﬁnement. They\\nprevent the gradual slide that happens when I don’t pay\\nclose attention. They provide an annual reminder to revisit\\nmy desired identity and consider how my habits are helping\\nme become the type of person I wish to be. They indicate\\nwhen I should upgrade my habits and take on new\\nchallenges and when I should dial my eﬀorts back and\\nfocus on the fundamentals.\\nReﬂection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily\\nhabits are powerful because of how they compound, but\\nworrying too much about every daily choice is like looking\\nat yourself in the mirror from an inch away . You can see\\nevery imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture.\\nThere is too much feedback. Conversely , never reviewing\\nyour habits is like never looking in the mirror . You aren’t\\naware of easily ﬁxable ﬂaws—a spot on your shirt, a bit of\\nfood in your teeth. There is too little feedback. P eriodic\\nreﬂection and review is like viewing yourself in the mirror\\nfrom a conversational distance. Y ou can see the important\\nchanges you should make without losing sight of the bigger\\npicture. Y ou want to view the entire mountain range, not\\nobsess over each peak and valley .\\nFinally , reﬂection and review oﬀers an ideal time to\\nrevisit one of the most important aspects of behavior\\nchange: identity .\\nHOW TO BREAK THE BELIEFS THA T HOLD Y OU BACK\\nIn the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up\\nevidence of your desired identity . As you latch on to that\\nnew identity , however , those same beliefs can hold you back\\nfrom the next level of growth. When working against you,\\nyour identity creates a kind of “pride” that encourages you\\nto deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly\\ngrowing. This is one of the greatest downsides of building\\nhabits.\\nThe more sacred an idea is to us—that is, the more\\ndeeply it is tied to our identity—the more strongly we will\\ndefend it against criticism. Y ou see this in every industry .\\nThe schoolteacher who ignores innovative teaching\\nmethods and sticks with her tried-and-true lesson plans.\\nThe veteran manager who is committed to doing things “his\\nway.” The surgeon who dismisses the ideas of her younger\\ncolleagues. The band who produces a mind-blowing ﬁrst\\nalbum and then gets stuck in a rut. The tighter we cling to\\nan identity , the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.\\nOne solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your\\nidentity an overwhelming portion of who you are. In the\\nwords of investor P aul Graham, “ keep your identity small.”\\nThe more you let a single belief deﬁne you, the less capable\\nyou are of adapting when life challenges you. If you tie\\neverything up in being the point guard or the partner at the\\nﬁrm or whatever else, then the loss of that facet of your life\\nwill wreck you. If you’re a vegan and then develop a health\\ncondition that forces you to change your diet, you’ll have an\\nidentity crisis on your hands. When you cling too tightly to\\none identity , you become brittle. Lose that one thing and\\nyou lose yourself .\\nFor most of my young life, being an athlete was a major\\npart of my identity . After my baseball career ended, I\\nstruggled to ﬁnd myself . When you spend your whole life\\ndeﬁning yourself in one way and that disappears, who are\\nyou now?\\nMilitary veterans and former entrepreneurs report\\nsimilar feelings. If your identity is wrapped up in a belief\\nlike “I’m a great soldier ,” what happens when your period\\nof service ends? F or many business owners, their identity is\\nsomething along the lines of “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the\\nfounder .” If you have spent every waking moment working\\non your business, how will you feel after you sell the\\ncompany?\\nThe key to mitigating these losses of identity is to\\nredeﬁne yourself such that you get to keep important\\naspects of your identity even if your particular role\\nchanges.\\n“I’m an athlete” becomes “I’m the type of person who\\nis mentally tough and loves a physical challenge.”\\n“I’m a great soldier” transforms into “I’m the type of\\nperson who is disciplined, reliable, and great on a\\nteam.”\\n“I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person\\nwho builds and creates things.”\\nWhen chosen eﬀectively , an identity can be ﬂexible\\nrather than brittle. Like water ﬂowing around an obstacle,\\nyour identity works with the changing circumstances rather\\nthan against them.\\nThe following quote from the Tao Te Ching  encapsulates\\nthe ideas perfectly:\\nMen are born soft and supple;\\ndead, they are stiﬀ and hard.\\nPlants are born tender and pliant;\\ndead, they are brittle and dry .\\nThus whoever is stiﬀ and inﬂexible\\nis a disciple of death.\\nWhoever is soft and yielding\\nis a disciple of life.\\nThe hard and stiﬀ will be broken.\\nThe soft and supple will prevail.\\n—LAO TZU\\nHabits deliver numerous beneﬁts, but the downside is\\nthat they can lock us into our previous patterns of thinking\\nand acting—even when the world is shifting around us.\\nEverything is impermanent. Life is constantly changing, so\\nyou need to periodically check in to see if your old habits\\nand beliefs are still serving you.\\nA lack of self -awareness is poison. Reﬂection and review\\nis the antidote.\\nChapter Summary\\nThe upside of habits is that we can do things without\\nthinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention\\nto little errors.\\nHabits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery\\nReﬂection and review is a process that allows you to\\nremain conscious of your performance over time.\\nThe tighter we cling to an identity , the harder it\\nbecomes to grow beyond it.\\nTConclusion\\nThe Secr et to R esults That Last\\nHERE IS AN ancient Greek parable known as the Sorites\\nParadox, * which talks about the eﬀect one small action\\ncan have when repeated enough times. One formulation of\\nthe paradox goes as follows: Can one coin make a person\\nrich? If you give a person a pile of ten coins, you wouldn’t\\nclaim that he or she is rich. But what if you add another?\\nAnd another? And another? A t some point, you will have to\\nadmit that no one can be rich unless one coin can make him\\nor her so .\\nWe can say the same about atomic habits. Can one tiny\\nchange transform your life? It’s unlikely you would say so .\\nBut what if you made another? And another? And another?\\nAt some point, you will have to admit that your life was\\ntransformed by one small change.\\nThe holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent\\nimprovement, but a thousand of them. It’s a bunch of\\natomic habits stacking up, each one a fundamental unit of\\nthe overall system.\\nIn the beginning, small improvements can often seem\\nmeaningless because they get washed away by the weight\\nof the system. Just as one coin won’t make you rich, one\\npositive change like meditating for one minute or reading\\none page each day is unlikely to deliver a noticeable\\ndiﬀerence.\\nGradually , though, as you continue to layer small\\nchanges on top of one another , the scales of life start to\\nmove. Each improvement is like adding a grain of sand to\\nthe positive side of the scale, slowly tilting things in your\\nfavor . Eventually , if you stick with it, you hit a tipping point.\\nSuddenly , it feels easier to stick with good habits. The\\nweight of the system is working for you rather than against\\nyou.\\nOver the course of this book, we’ve looked at dozens of\\nstories about top performers. W e’ve heard about Olympic\\ngold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders,\\nlifesaving physicians, and star comedians who have all used\\nthe science of small habits to master their craft and vault to\\nthe top of their ﬁeld. Each of the people, teams, and\\ncompanies we have covered has faced diﬀerent\\ncircumstances, but ultimately progressed in the same way:\\nthrough a commitment to tiny , sustainable, unrelenting\\nimprovements.\\nSuccess is not a goal to reach or a ﬁnish line to cross. It\\nis a system to improve, an endless process to reﬁne. In\\nChapter 1, I said, “If you’re having trouble changing your\\nhabits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system.\\nBad habits repeat themselves again and again not because\\nyou don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong\\nsystem for change.”\\nAs this book draws to a close, I hope the opposite is true.\\nWith the F our Laws of Behavior Change, you have a set of\\ntools and strategies that you can use to build better\\nsystems and shape better habits. Sometimes a habit will be\\nhard to remember and you’ll need to make it obvious . Other\\ntimes you won’t feel like starting and you’ll need to make it\\nattractive . In many cases, you may ﬁnd that a habit will be\\ntoo diﬀicult and you’ll need to make it easy . And\\nsometimes, you won’t feel like sticking with it and you’ll\\nneed to make it satisfying .\\nBehaviors are eﬀortless\\nhere.Behaviors are diﬀicult\\nhere.\\nObvious Invisible\\nAttractive Unattractive\\nEasy Hard\\nSatisf ying Unsatisf ying\\nYou want to push your good habits towar d the lef t side of the\\nspectrum by making them obvious, attractive, easy, and\\nsatisf ying. Meanwhile, you want to cluster your bad habits\\ntowar d the right side by making them invisible, unattractive,\\nhard, and unsatisf ying.\\nThis is a continuous process. There is no ﬁnish line.\\nThere is no permanent solution. Whenever you’re looking\\nto improve, you can rotate through the F our Laws of\\nBehavior Change until you ﬁnd the next bottleneck. Make it\\nobvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy . Make it\\nsatisfying.  Round and round. Always looking for the next\\nway to get 1 percent better .\\nThe secret to getting results that last is to never stop\\nmaking improvements. It’s remarkable what you can build\\nif you just don’t stop. It’s remarkable the business you can\\nbuild if you don’t stop working. It’s remarkable the body\\nyou can build if you don’t stop training. It’s remarkable the\\nknowledge you can build if you don’t stop learning. It’s\\nremarkable the fortune you can build if you don’t stop\\nsaving. It’s remarkable the friendships you can build if you\\ndon’t stop caring. Small habits don’t add up. They\\ncompound.\\nThat’s the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes.\\nRemarkable results.\\nAppendix\\nT\\nWhat Should You Read Next?\\nHANK YOU SO much for taking the time to read this book.\\nIt has been a pleasure sharing my work with you.

This\\nframework not only teaches us how to create new habits\\nbut also reveals some interesting insights about human\\nbehavior .\\nProblem phase\\n1. Cue\\n2. Craving\\nSolution phase\\n3. Response\\n4. Reward\\nIn this section, I have compiled some lessons (and a few\\nbits of common sense) that are conﬁrmed by the model.\\nThe purpose of these examples is to clarify just how useful\\nand wide-ranging this framework is when describing\\nhuman behavior . Once you understand the model, you’ll see\\nexamples of it everywhere.\\nAwareness comes before desire.  A craving is created\\nwhen you assign meaning to a cue. Y our brain constructs\\nan emotion or feeling to describe your current situation,\\nand that means a craving can only occur after you have\\nnoticed an opportunity .\\nHappiness is simply the absence of desire.  When you\\nobserve a cue, but do not desire to change your state, you\\nare content with the current situation. Happiness is not\\nabout the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or\\nsatisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when\\nyou have no urge to feel diﬀerently . Happiness is the state\\nyou enter when you no longer want to change your state.\\nHowever , happiness is ﬂeeting because a new desire\\nalways comes along. As Caed Budris says, “ Happiness is\\nthe space between one desire being fulﬁlled and a new\\ndesire forming.” Likewise, suﬀering is the space between\\ncraving a change in state and getting it.\\nIt is the idea of pleasure that we chase.  We seek the\\nimage of pleasure that we generate in our minds. A t the\\ntime of action, we do not know what it will be like to attain\\nthat image (or even if it will satisfy us). The feeling of\\nsatisfaction only comes afterward. This is what the Austrian\\nneurologist V ictor Frankl meant when he said that\\nhappiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue. Desire is\\npursued. Pleasure ensues from action.\\nPeace occurs when you don’t turn your observations\\ninto problems.  The ﬁrst step in any behavior is\\nobservation. Y ou notice a cue, a bit of information, an\\nevent. If you do not desire to act on what you observe, then\\nyou are at peace.\\nCraving is about wanting to ﬁx everything. Observation\\nwithout craving is the realization that you do not need to ﬁx\\nanything. Y our desires are not running rampant. Y ou do not\\ncrave a change in state. Y our mind does not generate a\\nproblem for you to solve. Y ou’re simply observing and\\nexisting.\\nWith a big enough why you can overcome any how.\\nFriedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher and poet,\\nfamously wrote, “ He who has a why to live for can bear\\nalmost any how .” This phrase harbors an important truth\\nabout human behavior . If your motivation and desire are\\ngreat enough (that is, why are you are acting), you’ll take\\naction even when it is quite diﬀicult. Great craving can\\npower great action—even when friction is high.\\nBeing curious is better than being smart.  Being\\nmotivated and curious counts for more than being smart\\nbecause it leads to action. Being smart will never deliver\\nresults on its own because it doesn’t get you to act. It is\\ndesire, not intelligence, that prompts behavior . As Naval\\nRavikant says, “The trick to doing anything is ﬁrst\\ncultivating a desire for it.”\\nEmotions drive behavior . Every decision is an\\nemotional decision at some level. Whatever your logical\\nreasons are for taking action, you only feel compelled to act\\non them because of emotion. In fact, people with damage to\\nemotional centers of the brain can list many reasons for\\ntaking action but still will not act because they do not have\\nemotions to drive them. This is why craving comes before\\nresponse. The feeling comes ﬁrst, and then the behavior .\\nWe can only be rational and logical after  we have\\nbeen emotional.  The primary mode of the brain is to feel;\\nthe secondary mode is to think. Our ﬁrst response—the\\nfast, nonconscious portion of the brain—is optimized for\\nfeeling and anticipating. Our second response—the slow ,\\nconscious portion of the brain—is the part that does the\\n“thinking.”\\nPsychologists refer to this as System 1 (feelings and\\nrapid judgments) versus System 2 (rational analysis). The\\nfeeling comes ﬁrst (System 1); the rationality only\\nintervenes later (System 2). This works great when the two\\nare aligned, but it results in illogical and emotional\\nthinking when they are not.\\nYour response tends to follow your emotions.  Our\\nthoughts and actions are rooted in what we ﬁnd attractive,\\nnot necessarily in what is logical. T wo people can notice the\\nsame set of facts and respond very diﬀerently because they\\nrun those facts through their unique emotional ﬁlter . This is\\none reason why appealing to emotion is typically more\\npowerful than appealing to reason. If a topic makes\\nsomeone feel emotional, they will rarely be interested in\\nthe data. This is why emotions can be such a threat to wise\\ndecision making.\\nPut another way: most people believe that the\\nreasonable response is the one that beneﬁts them: the one\\nthat satisﬁes their desires. T o approach a situation from a\\nmore neutral emotional position allows you to base your\\nresponse on the data rather than the emotion.\\nSuﬀering drives progress.  The source of all suﬀering\\nis the desire for a change in state. This is also the source of\\nall progress. The desire to change your state is what\\npowers you to take action. It is wanting more that pushes\\nhumanity to seek improvements, develop new technologies,\\nand reach for a higher level. W ith craving, we are\\ndissatisﬁed but driven. W ithout craving, we are satisﬁed\\nbut lack ambition.\\nYour actions reveal how badly you want something.\\nIf you keep saying something is a priority but you never act\\non it, then you don’t really want it. It’s time to have an\\nhonest conversation with yourself . Your actions reveal your\\ntrue motivations.\\nReward is on the other side of sacriﬁce.  Response\\n(sacriﬁce of energy) always precedes reward (the collection\\nof resources). The “runner’s high” only comes after the\\nhard run. The reward only comes after the energy is spent.\\nSelf-control is diﬀicult because it is not satisfying.\\nA reward is an outcome that satisﬁes your craving. This\\nmakes self -control ineﬀective because inhibiting our\\ndesires does not usually resolve them. Resisting temptation\\ndoes not satisfy your craving; it just ignores it. It creates\\nspace for the craving to pass. Self -control requires you to\\nrelease a desire rather than satisfy it.\\nOur expectations determine our satisfaction.  The\\ngap between our cravings and our rewards determines how\\nsatisﬁed we feel after taking action. If the mismatch\\nbetween expectations and outcomes is positive (surprise\\nand delight), then we are more likely to repeat a behavior\\nin the future. If the mismatch is negative (disappointment\\nand frustration), then we are less likely to do so .\\nFor example, if you expect to get $10 and get $100, you\\nfeel great. If you expect to get $100 and get $10, you feel\\ndisappointed. Y our expectation changes your satisfaction.\\nAn average experience preceded by high expectations is a\\ndisappointment. An average experience preceded by low\\nexpectations is a delight. When liking and wanting are\\napproximately the same, you feel satisﬁed.\\nSatisfaction = Liking – W anting\\nThis is the wisdom behind Seneca’s famous quote,\\n“Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.” If\\nyour wants outpace your likes, you’ll always be unsatisﬁed.\\nYou’re perpetually putting more weight on the problem\\nthan the solution.\\nHappiness is relative. When I ﬁrst began sharing my\\nwriting publicly it took me three months to get one\\nthousand subscribers. When I hit that milestone, I told my\\nparents and my girlfriend. W e celebrated. I felt excited and\\nmotivated. A few years later , I realized that one thousand\\npeople were signing up each day . And yet I didn’t even\\nthink to tell anyone. It felt normal. I was getting results\\nninety times faster than before but experiencing little\\npleasure over it. It wasn’t until a few days later that I\\nrealized how absurd it was that I wasn’t celebrating\\nsomething that would have seemed like a pipe dream just a\\nfew years before.\\nThe pain of failure correlates to the height of\\nexpectation.  When desire is high, it hurts to not like the\\noutcome. F ailing to attain something you want hurts more\\nthan failing to attain something you didn’t think much\\nabout in the ﬁrst place. This is why people say , “I don’t\\nwant to get my hopes up.”\\nFeelings come both before and after the behavior .\\nBefore acting, there is a feeling that motivates you to act—\\nthe craving. A fter acting, there is a feeling that teaches you\\nto repeat the action in the future—the reward.\\nCue > Craving (F eeling) > Response > Reward\\n(Feeling)\\nHow we feel inﬂuences how we act, and how we act\\ninﬂuences how we feel.\\nDesire initiates. Pleasure sustains.  Wanting and\\nliking are the two drivers of behavior . If it’s not desirable,\\nyou have no reason to do it. Desire and craving are what\\ninitiate a behavior . But if it’s not enjoyable, you have no\\nreason to repeat it. Pleasure and satisfaction are what\\nsustain a behavior . Feeling motivated gets you to act.\\nFeeling successful gets you to repeat.\\nHope declines with experience and is replaced by\\nacceptance.  The ﬁrst time an opportunity arises, there is\\nhope of what could be. Y our expectation (cravings) is based\\nsolely on promise . The second time around, your\\nexpectation is grounded in reality . You begin to understand\\nhow the process works and your hope is gradually traded\\nfor a more accurate prediction and acceptance of the likely\\noutcome.\\nThis is one reason why we continually grasp for the\\nlatest get-rich-quick or weight-loss scheme. New plans\\noﬀer hope because we don’t have any experiences to\\nground our expectations. New strategies seem more\\nappealing than old ones because they can have unbounded\\nhope. As Aristotle noted, “ Youth is easily deceived because\\nit is quick to hope.” P erhaps this can be revised to “ Youth is\\neasily deceived because it only hopes.” There is no\\nexperience to root the expectation in. In the beginning,\\nhope is all you have.\\nOHow to Apply These Ideas to\\nBusiness\\nVER THE YEARS , I’ve spoken at F ortune 500 companies\\nand growing start-ups about how to apply the science\\nof small habits to run more eﬀective businesses and build\\nbetter products.

In 1954, James Olds and P eter Milner , two neuroscientists at\\nMcGill University , decided to implant an electrode deep into the center of\\na rat’s brain. The precise placement of the electrode was largely\\nhappenstance; at the time, the geography of the mind remained a\\nmystery . But Olds and Milner got lucky . They inserted the needle right\\nnext to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a part of the brain that generates\\npleasurable feelings. Whenever you eat a piece of chocolate cake, or\\nlisten to a favorite pop song, or watch your favorite team win the W orld\\nSeries, it is your NAcc that helps you feel so happy . But Olds and Milner\\nquickly discovered that too much pleasure can be fatal. They placed the\\nelectrodes in several rodents’ brains and then ran a small current into\\neach wire, making the NAccs continually excited. The scientists noticed\\nthat the rodents lost interest in everything. They stopped eating and\\ndrinking. All courtship behavior ceased. The rats would just huddle in the\\ncorners of their cages, transﬁxed by their bliss. W ithin days, all of the\\nanimals had perished. They died of thirst.

In an email\\nconversation with Orland on October 18, 2016, he explained the origins of\\nthe story . “Yes, the ‘ceramics story’ in ‘ Art & F ear’ is indeed true, allowing\\nfor some literary license in the retelling. Its real-world origin was as a\\ngambit employed by photographer Jerry Uelsmann to motivate his\\nBeginning Photography students at the University of Florida. As retold in\\n‘Art & F ear’ it faithfully captures the scene as Jerry told it to me—except I\\nreplaced photography with ceramics as the medium being explored.\\nAdmittedly , it would’ve been easier to retain photography as the art\\nmedium being discussed, but David Bayles (co-author) & I are both\\nphotographers ourselves, and at the time we were consciously trying to\\nbroaden the range of media being referenced in the text. The intriguing\\nthing to me is that it hardly matters what art form was invoked—the\\nmoral of the story appears to hold equally true straight across the whole\\nart spectrum (and even outside the arts, for that matter).” Later in that\\nsame email, Orland said, “ You have our permission to reprint any or all of\\nthe ‘ceramics’ passage in your forthcoming book.” In the end, I settled on\\npublishing an adapted version, which combines their telling of the\\nceramics story with facts from the original source of Uelsmann’s\\nphotography students.

Concrete behavioral traits that\\npatently depend on content provided by the home or culture are, of\\ncourse, not heritable at all; which language you speak, which religion you\\nworship in, which political party you belong to . But behavioral traits that\\nreﬂect the underlying talents and temperaments are heritable: how\\nproﬁcient with language you are, how religious, how liberal or\\nconservative. General intelligence is heritable, and so are the ﬁve major\\nways in which personality can vary . . . openness to experience,\\nconscientiousness, extroversion-introversion, antagonism-agreeableness,\\nand neuroticism. And traits that are surprisingly speciﬁc turn out to be\\nheritable, too, such as dependence on nicotine or alcohol, number of\\nhours of television watched, and likelihood of divorcing.

Y ou\\ncan see my thoughts at atomichabits.com/cycling .\\n* I geeked out and actually calculated this.\\nWashington, D .C., is about 225 miles from New Y ork\\nCity. Assuming you are ﬂying on a 747 or an Airbus\\nA380, changing the heading by 3.5 degrees as you\\nleave Los Angeles likely causes the nose of the\\nairplane to shift between 7.2 to 7.6 feet, or about 86\\nto 92 inches. A very small shift in direction can lead\\nto a very meaningful change in destination.\\n* The terms unconscious , nonconscious , and\\nsubconscious  can all be used to describe the absence\\nof awareness or thought. Even in academic circles,\\nthese words are often used interchangeably without\\nmuch nitpicking (for once). Nonconscious  is the term\\nI’m going to use because it is broad enough to\\nencompass both the processes of the mind we could\\nnever consciously access and the moments when we\\nare simply not paying attention to what surrounds\\nus. Nonconscious  is a description of anything you are\\nnot consciously thinking about.\\n* Certainly , there are some aspects of your identity\\nthat tend to remain unchanged over time—like\\nidentifying as someone who is tall or short. But even\\nfor more ﬁxed qualities and characteristics, whether\\nyou view them in a positive or negative light is\\ndetermined by your experiences throughout life.\\n* Readers of  The P ower of Habit  by Charles Duhigg\\nwill recognize these terms. Duhigg wrote a great\\nbook and my intention is to pick up where he left oﬀ\\nby integrating these stages into four simple laws you\\ncan apply to build better habits in life and work.\\n* Charles Duhigg and Nir Eyal deserve special\\nrecognition for their inﬂuence on this image. This\\nrepresentation of the habit loop is a combination of\\nlanguage that was popularized by Duhigg’s book,\\nThe P ower of Habit , and a design that was\\npopularized by Eyal’s book, Hooked .\\n* When I visited Japan, I saw this strategy save a\\nwoman’s life. Her young son stepped onto the\\nShinkansen, one of Japan’s famous bullet trains that\\ntravel at over two hundred miles per hour , just as the\\ndoors were closing. She was left outside on the\\nplatform and jammed her arm through the door to\\ngrab him. W ith her arm stuck in the door , the train\\nwas about to take oﬀ , but right before it pulled away\\nan employee performed a safety check by P ointing-\\nand-Calling up and down the platform. In less than\\nﬁve seconds, he noticed the woman and managed to\\nstop the train from leaving. The door opened, the\\nwoman—now in tears—ran to her son, and a minute\\nlater the train departed safely .\\n* Interested readers can get a template to create\\ntheir own Habits Scorecard at\\natomichabits.com/scorecard .\\n* In addition to her payment for the library ,\\nCatherine the Great asked Diderot to keep the books\\nuntil she needed them and oﬀered to pay him a\\nyearly salary to act as her librarian.\\n* Fogg refers to this strategy as the “Tiny Habits\\nrecipe,” but I'll call it the habit stacking formula\\nthroughout the book.\\n* If you’re looking for more examples and guidance,\\nyou can download a Habit Stacking template at\\natomichabits.com/habitstacking .\\n* Dopamine is not the only chemical that inﬂuences\\nyour habits. Every behavior involves multiple brain\\nregions and neurochemicals, and anyone who claims\\nthat “habits are all about dopamine” is skipping over\\nmajor portions of the process. It is just one of the\\nimportant role players in habit formation. However , I\\nwill single out the dopamine circuit in this chapter\\nbecause it provides a window into the biological\\nunderpinnings of desire, craving, and motivation that\\nare behind every habit.\\n* I’m so happy I was able to ﬁt a Game of Thrones\\nreference into this book.\\n* This is just a partial list of underlying motives. I\\noﬀer a more complete list and more examples of how\\nto apply them to business at\\natomichabits.com/business .\\n* A similar story is told in the book Art & F ear by\\nDavid Bayles and T ed Orland. It has been adapted\\nhere with permission. See the endnotes for a full\\nexplanation.\\n* This is a foundational principle in physics, where it\\nis known as the Principle of Least Action. It states\\nthat the path followed between any two points will\\nalways be the path requiring the least energy . This\\nsimple principle underpins the laws of the universe.\\nFrom this one idea, you can describe the laws of\\nmotion and relativity .\\n* The phrase addition by subtraction  is also used by\\nteams and businesses to describe removing people\\nfrom a group in order to make the team stronger\\noverall.\\n* To be fair , this still sounds like an amazing night.\\n* I designed a habit journal speciﬁcally to make\\njournaling easier . It includes a “One Line P er Day”\\nsection where you simply write one sentence about\\nyour day . You can learn more at\\natomichabits.com/journal .\\n* The irony of how closely this story matches my\\nprocess of writing this book is not lost on me.\\nAlthough my publisher was much more\\naccommodating, and my closet remained full, I did\\nfeel like I had to place myself on house arrest to\\nﬁnish the manuscript.\\n* This is also referred to as a “Ulysses pact” or a\\n“Ulysses contract.” Named after Ulysses, the hero of\\nThe Odyssey , who told his sailors to tie him to the\\nmast of the ship so that he could hear the\\nenchanting song of the Sirens but wouldn’t be able\\nto steer the ship toward them and crash on the\\nrocks. Ulysses realized the beneﬁts of locking in\\nyour future actions while your mind is in the right\\nplace rather than waiting to see where your desires\\ntake you in the moment.\\n* The shift to a delayed-return environment likely\\nbegan around the advent of agriculture ten thousand\\nyears ago when farmers began planting crops in\\nanticipation of a harvest months later . However , it\\nwas not until recent centuries that our lives became\\nﬁlled with delayed-return choices: career planning,\\nretirement planning, vacation planning, and\\neverything else that occupies our calendars.\\n* Time inconsistency is also referred to as hyperbolic\\ndiscounting .\\n* This can derail our decision making as well. The\\nbrain overestimates the danger of anything that\\nseems like an immediate threat but has almost no\\nlikelihood of actually occurring: your plane crashing\\nduring a bit of turbulence, a burglar breaking in\\nwhile you’re home alone, a terrorist blowing up the\\nbus you’re on. Meanwhile, it underestimates what\\nappears to be a distant threat but is actually very\\nlikely: the steady accumulation of fat from eating\\nunhealthy food, the gradual decay of your muscles\\nfrom sitting at a desk, the slow creep of clutter when\\nyou fail to tidy up.\\n* Interested readers can ﬁnd a habit tracker\\ntemplate at atomichabits.com/tracker .\\n* You can see the actual Habit Contracts used by\\nBryan Harris and get a blank template at\\natomichabits.com/contract .\\n* If you are interested in taking a personality test,\\nyou can ﬁnd links to the most reliable tests here:\\natomichabits.com/personality .\\n* If it’s Harry P otter on repeat, I feel you.\\n* I have a pet theory about what happens when we\\nachieve a ﬂow state. This isn’t conﬁrmed. It’s just my\\nguess. P sychologists commonly refer to the brain as\\noperating in two modes: System 1 and System 2.\\nSystem 1 is fast and instinctual. Generally speaking,\\nprocesses you can perform very quickly (like habits)\\nare governed by System 1. Meanwhile, System 2\\ncontrols thinking processes that are more eﬀortful\\nand slow—like calculating the answer to a diﬀicult\\nmath problem. W ith regard to ﬂow , I like to imagine\\nSystem 1 and System 2 as residing on opposite ends\\nof the spectrum of thinking. The more automatic a\\ncognitive process is, the more it slides toward the\\nSystem 1 side of the spectrum. The more eﬀortful a\\ntask is, the more it slides toward System 2. Flow , I\\nbelieve, resides on the razor’s edge between System\\n1 and System 2. Y ou are fully using all of your\\nautomatic and implicit knowledge related to the task\\nwhile also working hard to rise to a challenge\\nbeyond your ability . Both brain modes are fully\\nengaged. The conscious and nonconscious are\\nworking perfectly in sync.\\n* The discovery of variable rewards happened by\\naccident. One day in the lab, the famous Harvard\\npsychologist B. F . Skinner was running low on food\\npellets during one experiment and making more was\\na time-consuming process because he had to\\nmanually press the pellets in a machine. This\\nsituation led him to “ask myself why every press of\\nthe lever had to be reinforced.” He decided to only\\ngive treats to the rats intermittently and, to his\\nsurprise, varying the delivery of food did not\\ndecrease behavior , but actually increased it.\\n* I created a template for readers interested in\\nkeeping a decision journal. It is included as part of\\nthe habit journal at atomichabits.com/journal .\\n* You can see my previous Annual Reviews at\\njamesclear .com/annual-review .\\n* You can see my previous Integrity Reports at\\njamesclear .com/integrity .\\n* Sorites is derived from the Greek word sorós ,\\nwhich means heap  or pile.\"}\n"
